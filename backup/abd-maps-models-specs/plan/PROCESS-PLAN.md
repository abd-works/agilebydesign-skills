# abd-maps-models-specs — reusable process plan

*Working plan — lives in `plan/` (transient). Long-lived reference docs belong in `docs/`.*

This plan describes a **repeatable** path from **source markdown** through **evidence**, **vocabulary layers**, **shaped story map**, and **sparse domain types**, to a **validated** map / model / spec. It is written so principles can be **argued on merit**: each has **stated grounding** (research and established practice), not reactions to any prior attempt.

**Fixture in scope:** `skills/abd-maps-models-specs/test/sample-workspace/` — workspace paths and roles for canonical sources live in **`solution.conf` → `manifest_sources`** (the sample lists `docs/sample.md`); `context/chunks/` and `context/context_index.json` **when present** (they may **not** exist yet—see Stage 1 below).

**Not the skill package:** Generated pipeline artifacts go **only** under `test/sample-workspace/abd-maps-models-specs/` (output root — same name as the skill **by convention**, not a second copy of the skill). The skill itself (plan, `SKILL.md`, automation) lives in `skills/abd-maps-models-specs/` **above** `test/`.

## Stages vs. Phase 0 (read this)

The **process table** in `content/parts/process.md` groups work into **stages** (e.g. Stage 1 — Context & evidence).

- **Phase 0** is **structural**: **AI-led** scan of big Markdown, **draft `context_chunking_spec`** (with assumptions/gaps disclosed), **human** secondary review and acceptance so splits match real layout. **Skip** a full re-run when the spec already matches current sources.
- **Phase 1** **does not assume** `chunks/` already exist. Typical path: **PDF (or other source) → canonical Markdown →** Phase 0 **rules** **→** first chunking + index. The **validator** checks **contract shape**, not “readiness.”

## Principles we commit to (positive)

These are **normative**: we implement the process **because** of them. If evidence shows a principle is wrong for a domain, **change the principle** (and this document)—do not silently bend the process.

| **Provenance-first evidence**               | Traceability in requirements engineering (e.g. IEEE-style bidirectional trace); evidence-based methods in policy and safety-critical domains; DDD emphasis on **distilling** the model **from** the source, not inventing ahead of it. | **Two separate moves:** (1) **Evidence** ties claims to **where** they come from (`chunk_id` / anchors). (2) **Promotion** decides **what** they become—term, mechanism, story, property, enum, type, relationship—using **that layer’s** criteria. Citations are **necessary** for substantive choices; they are **not sufficient** to mint a class or edge. | Same links can support honest **layering**; traceability without **automatic** typing.            | Treating “cited here” as “therefore a `concepts[]` row”; skipping promotion because traceability already passed.                                         |
| **Behavioral description of value**         | Use-case and scenario modeling (e.g. Jacobson); story mapping (Patton); realized **through** **story maps**, **stories**, and **story specifications** (BDD-style **when/then** scenarios).                                            | **Stories** are **interactions**: primary **actor** performs an **operation** on a **subject** in the domain. **Anchor** each story: **what** state (or read model / projection) the interaction **uses** or **changes** (and name **policy/SLO** only when it is part of the spec for that story—not a separate mandatory template in *this* process). Distinguish **mutation** of authoritative domain state vs **observation**—**reads**, **pass-through**, **forward**, **query** all count; not every story implies an aggregate **write**. **When/then** still asserts something **verifiable** (including observable reads or effects). Optional secondary actors. Structure lives in the **story map**; the written **spec** is scenarios / when-then / AC on each story. | Maps that read as **capability**, not noun lists; one clear behavioral lane (map → story → spec). | Stories that are only labels, tables, or ungrounded fragments; **extra** behavioral write-ups that **duplicate** map/story/spec without a stated reason. |
| **Layered vocabulary**                      | Ontology engineering: **terms** vs **classes**; DDD **ubiquitous language** vs **model**; separation of **glossary** from **type system**.                                                                                             | **Terms** and **named mechanisms** (processes, lifecycles) live in **their own** artifacts; **domain types** are promoted **only** through the type gate—not by renaming a mention.                                                                                                                                                                           | Shared language; controlled growth of types; **distinct** promotion paths per layer.              | One-step “surface word → class” without a **separate** promotion decision.                                                                               |

**Rule (cross-cutting):** **Where** something is anchored (evidence) and **what** it is in the model (term, story, property, type, …) are **different states**. The process may reuse the same `chunk_id` in more than one layer; each layer applies its own gate.

**Rule (behavioral anchoring):** A story need not **mutate** core domain state; it must be **anchored**—**which** state or projection is **read**, **passed**, or **forwarded**, **or** **which** state is **written**, **or** **which** constraint/SLO applies. **Read** and **write** paths are both **first-class**; silence on anchor is not.

**How to attack a principle:** Bring **counterexamples** from a domain, or **citations** that the grounding does not hold; then **revise** the table and the phases below in the same edit.

| Asset                                 | Role                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test/sample-workspace/solution.conf`              | **Workspace config** — `manifest_sources[]`, `context_path`, `context_chunking_spec`, etc. (same layering as the prior skill).     |
| `test/sample-workspace/docs/sample.md`     | Canonical **source** markdown for the bundled example (listed in `manifest_sources`; pin version when it changes).                     |
| `test/sample-workspace/context/chunks/unit_*.md`   | **Evidence units** — text + stable IDs for citation.                                                                             |
| `test/sample-workspace/context/context_index.json` | Index: **manifest** (sources, section counts) + **blocks** with `block_id`, `section_path`, `reason`, `evidence_type`, previews. |
| `test/sample-workspace/abd-maps-models-specs/`     | **Output only** — phase artifacts the skill **generates** (not the skill package; see folder README).                            |


**Phase 0** (**context chunking approach**): **AI** reads large canonical Markdown **before** you rely on citations; **drafts `context_chunking_spec`** and reports what it did; **human** reviews and lands the YAML—see `content/parts/phases/context-chunking-approach.md`. This is **not** a pass/fail “readiness” gate. **Phase 1** **builds** `chunks/` + `context_index.json` from that spec.

---

## Phase 0 — Context chunking approach

**Goal:** Understand how the handbook is **written** so chunking **rules** support the pipeline. **AI** drafts **`context_chunking_spec`** (and discloses assumptions); **human** accepts after review; optional **context audit** metrics for tuning. **Normative:** `content/parts/phases/context-chunking-approach.md`.

**When `chunks/` do not exist yet:** Phase 0 defines **how** you will chunk; Phase 1 **implements** that spec and the contract validator checks **shape**—not “did you pass readiness.”

Normative steps live in **`content/parts/phases/context-chunking-approach.md`** (and **`canonical-context.md`** for the build). The old subsections **0.1–0.4** / outcomes tables in this plan are **deprecated**—do not use them as gates.

---

## Phase 1 — Canonical context: source Markdown → chunking → Phase 1 context contract

**Goal:** A **single, versioned** contract for “what evidence is,” independent of map/model/spec JSON.

**Do not assume** pre-existing `chunks/`. Typical upstream steps:

1. **Canonical source Markdown** — Often one or more `.md` files produced by **PDF (or DOCX, etc.) → Markdown** conversion. Pin version (hash/date) of the **source file** and of the **converter** when relevant.
2. **First chunking + index** — Chunking is **designed** (not ad hoc splits) so downstream work can honor the **principles**:
   - **Provenance-first evidence:** stable `chunk_id` / anchors; traceable citations.
   - **Layered vocabulary / promotion:** per-chunk **evidence typing** (and related fields) so **terms** vs **types** stays honest—**citation ≠ class**.
   - **Corpus understanding before type design:** grain supports **stratified reading**; **noise** is labeled and excluded **explicitly** in the index, not silently dropped.
   - **Spot-check test:** metadata should make it **plausible** to see what is **not** a subtype candidate (`modeling_kind` or equivalent).

**Automation:** implement **one** Phase 1 context-build path under **`skills/abd-maps-models-specs/scripts/`** (see [`content/parts/library/context-spec.md`](../content/parts/library/context-spec.md) — runnable pipeline is part of Phase 1, not a separate pre-phase): canonical Markdown → rules in `context_chunking_spec.yaml` → `chunks/` + `context_index.json`. **Rules first**, then code.

### 1.1 Artifacts

- `chunk-index.json` (or evolved `context_index.json`) with at minimum: `chunk_id`, `source_anchor`, `modeling_kind`, `evidence_type`, `modeling_priority`, optional `candidate_terms[]`.
- **Rules:** Promotion of `example` / `narrative_aside` / `metadata/noise` into `extends` or `concepts[]` uses an explicit **promotion** record.

### 1.2 Validation

- Script: every file under `chunks/` has index row; every index row has a file (or documented orphan).
- **Relationship edges** (e.g. `extends`, `inherits`) enter the model only through **explicit** steps with **stated** criteria—not from **string co-occurrence** heuristics in code.

### 1.3 Exit criteria

- Readiness outcome **documented** (adopt vs rebuild—and **rebuild** is expected when starting from a bad or missing package).
- Index schema **pinned** as v1 of the **context contract** for this skill.

### 1.4 Phase 1 package (how Phase 1 proves provenance)

Principles are not enough: **Phase 1** must be specified as **files, validators, and config**—not “whatever the script outputs.” The normative detail lives in **[`content/parts/library/context-spec.md`](../content/parts/library/context-spec.md)**. Summary:

| Mechanism | What we use |
| --- | --- |
| **Single pipeline** | Runnable automation under **`skills/abd-maps-models-specs/scripts/`** — one Phase 1 context builder entry point per [`context-spec.md`](../content/parts/library/context-spec.md). |
| **Chunk files** | Under **`solution.conf` → `context_path`** (default `context/` under the workspace): `chunks/{chunk_id}.md` with YAML front matter: `chunk_id`, `source` (canonical path + **line range and/or heading_path**), `evidence_type`, `modeling_kind`. *Example paths when workspace is `test/sample-workspace/`: `test/sample-workspace/context/chunks/…`.* |
| **Index** | `context_index.json` next to `chunks/` (e.g. `test/sample-workspace/context/context_index.json` only when that is your workspace). `manifest.sources[]` with **sha256** of canonical handbook; `manifest.generator`; `blocks[]` with duplicate `source_anchor` + previews; optional `excluded[]`. |
| **Config** | Chunking YAML named by **`solution.conf` → `context_chunking_spec`** (workspace-relative; default `context_chunking_spec.yaml`). *Example when workspace is `test/sample-workspace/`: `test/sample-workspace/context_chunking_spec.yaml`.* Section/chapter break rules, split limits, taxonomy enums—you edit **this file**, not scattered magic in multiple scripts. |
| **Code vs LLM** | **Deterministic** Python applies the spec and writes chunks + index. Optional LLM may **refine** `evidence_type` / `modeling_kind` **after** blocks exist; output must still pass the same validator. |
| **Validation** | **`python scripts/build.py`** runs the **stage-1-context-decisions** check (scanner path in `rules/scanners.json`) — bidirectional chunk ↔ index, line bounds, duplicate IDs. |

Downstream (Phases 2–8): same doc spells out **inputs/outputs**, how **terms/mechanisms/candidate** JSON must cite `chunk_id`s, how the **shaped-story-shape** rule’s scanner checks `evidence_chunk_ids[]` against the index (via **`build.py`**), and how later phases use JSON, prompts, or scanners—so each step has an implementable shape.

---

## Phase 2 — Terms & mechanisms (layers A & B)

**Goal:** Glossary and **named processes** exist **before** sparse `concepts[]`.

- **Terms** — surface vocabulary + chunk links; not classes.
- **Mechanisms** — workflows/lifecycles with steps + evidence.
- **Candidate queue** — “possible type” with rationale; **not** in `concepts[]` yet.

**Exit:** Promotion rule written: **candidate → concept** only through Phase 4 gate.

---

## Phase 3 — Shaped story map

**Goal:** Epics/stories that satisfy **actor → behavior → anchor** (domain state **read** and/or **write**); alignment allows **term** references without minting types. **Query/read/forward** stories are as valid as **mutating** stories when the anchor is explicit.

**Exit:** Every story has a **clear** behavioral reading and **traceability** to concepts; no story exists solely to **match strings** in the type list. Every story states its **anchor** (read path, write path, or both)—not every story requires **mutation** of the core write model.

**Why before domain types (Phase 4)?** Short rationale: [`content/parts/library/story-map.md`](../content/parts/library/story-map.md#why-story-mapping-before-domain-types).

---

## Phase 4 — Domain types (`concepts[]`)

**Goal:** **Sparse** types; **reject gate** (“not just a property on a broader type”).

**Exit:** Type count and **per-type rationale** remain tractable for the chosen workspace at the chosen depth.

---

## Phase 5 — Variant classification

**Goal:** Per family: **enum vs `extends`** **before** property churn.

**Exit:** Written **variant decision** per family before bulk modeling.

---

## Phase 6 — Deepen

**Goal:** Responsibilities and evidence on **approved** types only; **topological** `depends_on`.

**Exit:** Every type has **evidence** citations; citations **support** claims, they do not **auto-create** types.

---

## Phase 7 — Integrate

**Goal:** Synonyms, repointing, **drain candidate queue** into final `map-model-spec` (or split artifacts if you keep story map separate).

---

## Phase 8 — Validate

**Goal:** Automated checks (scanners, schema) + **manifest and pipeline outputs**; CI on your configured workspace; optional **critic** checklist against the **principles table** at the top of this document. (Slug: **`validate`** — see [`content/parts/process.md`](../content/parts/process.md); process table uses **phase 10** for the same gate.)

---

## Execution order (what to do next)

1. **Context path A — Greenfield or known bad:** Ensure **canonical Markdown** (e.g. PDF → handbook `.md`). **Write the chunking spec** (what grain, what metadata, what exclusions), then implement **Phase 1** (chunks + index + version pin). Use **Phase 0** questions as **acceptance** for that package before freezing v1.
2. **Context path B — Existing `context/`:** Run **readiness** (**context audit**: metrics + spot-check)—**or** skip straight to rebuild if you already know it fails (e.g. spot-check says **no**).
3. If **adopt with extensions:** migrate or sidecar into canonical schema; fill `modeling_kind`; **pin** v1 (manifest-backed).
4. If **rebuild or first build:** complete Phase 1; **finalize** the Phase 1 context package (see **§1.4** below and [`content/parts/library/context-spec.md`](../content/parts/library/context-spec.md)).
5. Only then: **Phase 2** onward in order — run `python scripts/build_terms_mechanisms_scaffold.py` — writes empty `terms_layer.json`, `mechanisms.json`, and `candidate_queue.json` under your workspace **`output_dir`** (e.g. `spec/`). See [`content/parts/library/terms-mechanisms-contract.md`](../content/parts/library/terms-mechanisms-contract.md). Re-run `generate_context_bundle_manifest.py` to record hashes for those files.
6. **Phase 3**: maintain **`shaped_story_map.json`** at the root of **`output_dir`** (epics/stories with **anchor** + `term_refs` / `evidence_chunk_ids`; **`map-model-spec.json`** holds modules and concepts only). Validate with **`python scripts/build.py`** (includes **phase3-story-map-evidence** when the story map exists; extend per [`shaped-story-map.md`](../content/parts/phases/shaped-story-map.md)). Re-run `generate_context_bundle_manifest.py` for phase3 hash.
7. **Phase 4–8** (this plan) / **6–10** ([`process.md`](../content/parts/process.md)): types → variants → deepen → integrate → **validate** (per phase files; CLI: `python scripts/generate_prompt.py --phase validate`).

## Success definition (reusable)

Another domain (another handbook) should be able to:

1. Supply **source material** (typically **PDF → Markdown**, then chunking) and land on the **same context contract** after Phase 1 (`context_index.json` + context chunks + rules).
2. Run **2–8** such that **relationships** and **types** follow **explicit** gates and the **principles table**—not accidental **co-occurrence** or **string matching**.
