## Every epic needs confirming stories

An `epic.statement` makes a behavioral claim. At least one story under that epic (directly or via `sub_epics`) must **confirm** that claim — its `trigger` / `response` should exercise the same actors and domain concepts named in the statement.

**How many names in `confirming_stories[]`:** As **many as required** so the **foundational concepts** that epic is responsible for are **validated** in story form — not a default of two, not a ceiling. Add story names until coverage is honest; the mechanical scanner only checks **at least one** non-empty name so the list is never empty.

**Scaffold JSON (`confirming_stories[]` on the epic):** Domain nouns in those strings must **`concepts[].name`** **exactly** (100% match) — **`scaffold-concept-story-name-alignment`**. Non-negotiable alongside this rule.

The scanner (`scripts/scanners/epic_requires_confirming_stories.py`) checks overlap between bolded terms in the statement and each story's trigger/response.

**DO** align story text with the epic statement so concepts and actors reappear.

```json
{
  "modules_and_epics": [
    {
      "module": { "name": "Payments", "concepts": [] },
      "epic": {
        "name": "Wire release",
        "statement": "**Customer** submits **WireTransfer**; **System** runs **LimitChecker** before **SettlementBatch**.",
        "statement_chunk": "chunk-w1",
        "stories": [
          {
            "name": "Happy path limits pass",
            "trigger": "**Customer** submits **WireTransfer** for amount within limits",
            "response": "**System** runs **LimitChecker**, approves, and enqueues **SettlementBatch**"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

```json
{
  "modules_and_epics": [
    {
      "module": { "name": "Retail", "concepts": [] },
      "epic": {
        "name": "Retail promotions",
        "statement": "**Cashier** adds **LineItem** to **Cart**; **System** applies **Promotion** rules.",
        "statement_chunk": "chunk-r1",
        "sub_epics": [
          {
            "name": "Stacking",
            "stories": [
              {
                "name": "Second promo on same cart",
                "trigger": "**Cashier** adds a second **Promotion** to **Cart** with multiple **LineItem** rows",
                "response": "**System** recomputes discounts per stacking policy"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**DO NOT** leave an epic with only unrelated stories — no shared bolded concepts with the statement.

```json
{
  "modules_and_epics": [
    {
      "module": { "name": "Payments", "concepts": [] },
      "epic": {
        "name": "Wire release",
        "statement": "**Customer** submits **WireTransfer**; **System** runs **LimitChecker**.",
        "statement_chunk": "chunk-w1",
        "stories": [
          {
            "name": "Password reset email",
            "trigger": "**Customer** requests password reset",
            "response": "**System** sends email token"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

No overlap with **WireTransfer** or **LimitChecker** — violation.

**DO NOT** use a generic story that never names the epic's domain concepts.

```json
{
  "modules_and_epics": [
    {
      "module": { "name": "Combat", "concepts": [] },
      "epic": {
        "name": "Combat resolution",
        "statement": "**Player** rolls **Attack** against **ArmorClass**.",
        "statement_chunk": "chunk-srd-1",
        "stories": [
          {
            "name": "Session start",
            "trigger": "**Player** joins table",
            "response": "**System** shows welcome screen"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

No **Attack** or **ArmorClass** in stories — violation.
