# Validation

## Three-Layer Model

Each AI phase uses three validation layers. All three are required.

**Layer 1 — Generate with rules.** Phase spec + accumulated rules are included in the generation instructions. Follow DO/DO NOT guidance while producing output. Rules are guidance — produce natural output that complies.

**Layer 2 — Scan.** After generation, run `pipeline.py scan <phase>`. Scanners check structural violations mechanically (naming, child counts, concept sync, property types). Fix reported violations before proceeding.

**Layer 3 — Validate.** After scanners, run `pipeline.py validate <phase>`. This prints all applicable rules. AI re-reads generated output against the rules AND the completeness checklists in Domain Model Format and Interaction Tree Format above. For each rule: does the output comply with the spirit, not just the letter? Report violations with rule name, location, proposed fix. Fix all violations. Re-validate until clean.

**This layer is critical.** Be adversarial. Take a contrarian stance. A scanner says "all clear" but the AI reviewing the rules sees that 3 operations on a concept all make decisions that belong to other concepts.

## AI Behavior Per Layer


| Layer           | Behavior                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Generation      | Follow rules naturally while producing output                                       |
| Scanner fixes   | Fix reported violations mechanically; re-run until clean                            |
| Validation pass | Adversarial checklist review — each rule is a checklist item; report ALL violations |

## Corrections Format

When recording corrections:

- **DO** or **DO NOT** rule
- **Example (wrong):** What was done incorrectly
- **Example (correct):** What it should be
- **Scanner or rule:** (if applicable) Name of scanner or rule that caught the error
- **Likely source:** (if known) One of: code issue | prompt issue | rule priority | rule guidance quality
