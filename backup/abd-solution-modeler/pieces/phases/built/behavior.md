# Critical Quality Steps

**These steps MUST be followed for every AI phase. No exceptions.**

---

## DO NOT write scripts for AI phases

**AI phases = the AI does the work.** You read the inputs, reason about them, and produce the output directly.

**DO** read the inputs (hypothesis.json, evidence/, context chunks), analyze them, and edit/write the output files yourself.

**DO NOT** write a Python (or other) script to "run" the phase. Do not create `synthesize_concepts.py`, `build_structure.py`, or similar. The pipeline has no script runners for AI phases — by design. Writing a script delegates the cognitive work to code; the AI must perform it.

Wrong: "I'll create a script that merges concepts and builds hierarchy."
Right: "I'll read the hypothesis and actions, curate concepts, build the hierarchy from evidence, and write the refined hypothesis.json."

---

## Step 0 — Deep Scan of Evidence and Conceptual Guidance (REQUIRED FIRST)

Before generating any output, you MUST:

1. **Do a deep scan of the evidence** — Read all files in `evidence/` (terms.json, actions.json, decisions.json, states.json, relationships.json, modifiers.json, evidence_graph.json). Understand every concept, every action, every decision, every state.
2. **Do a deep examination of the conceptual guidance** — Read `concept_guidance.md` and `concept_guidance.json`. Examine ALL concepts. Understand the nuance at a very detailed level.
3. **Verify understanding** — Before writing, confirm you can articulate: What are the key mechanisms? What are the subtypes and their distinct data/behavior? What variations exist? What constraints apply?

Do not proceed to generation until you have done this deep scan. Shallow or partial understanding produces shallow, broken models.

---

## Three-Stage Process (MUST follow for every AI step)

Each AI phase uses three validation layers. All three are required.

**Layer 1 — Generate with rules.** Phase spec + accumulated rules are included in the generation instructions. Follow DO/DO NOT guidance while producing output. Rules are guidance — produce natural output that complies.

**Layer 2 — Scan.** After generation, run `pipeline.py scan <phase>`. Scanners check structural violations mechanically (naming, child counts, concept sync, property types). Fix reported violations before proceeding.

**Layer 3 — Validate.** After scanners, run `pipeline.py validate <phase>`. This prints all applicable rules. AI re-reads generated output against the rules AND the completeness checklists. For each rule: does the output comply with the spirit, not just the letter? Report violations with rule name, location, proposed fix. Fix all violations. Re-validate until clean.

**This layer is critical.** Be adversarial. Take a contrarian stance. A scanner says "all clear" but the AI reviewing the rules sees that 3 operations on a concept all make decisions that belong to other concepts.

---

## AI Behavior Per Layer

| Layer           | Behavior                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Step 0          | Deep scan evidence + concept_guidance; verify understanding before generating       |
| Generation      | Pay strict attention to rules naturally while producing output                      |
| Scanner fixes   | Fix reported violations mechanically; re-run until clean                            |
| Validation pass | Adversarial checklist review — each rule is a checklist item; report ALL violations |

---

## Corrections Format

When recording corrections:

- **DO** or **DO NOT** rule
- **Example (wrong):** What was done incorrectly
- **Example (correct):** What it should be
- **Scanner or rule:** (if applicable) Name of scanner or rule that caught the error
- **Likely source:** (if known) One of: code issue | prompt issue | rule priority | rule guidance quality


---

# Phase 8 — Behavior

**Actor:** AI

## Purpose

Assign operations to concepts by decision ownership; link each behavior to the step(s) that exercise it; group steps into scenarios.

## Trigger

behavior model, assign operations, trigger response, linked behaviors

## Inputs

- `generated/solution_model.json` v1 (from Structure)

## Instructions

- Assign operations to concepts based on interaction steps
- Link each step to at least one behavior (linked_behaviors)
- Group steps into scenarios (e.g. hit vs miss)
- Add Trigger, Response to steps

## Outputs

`generated/solution_model.json` v2 — concepts gain operations, behavior_refs; interaction_tree gains linked_behaviors, when_then, scenarios


---

# Solution Model Format

# Solution Model Format (solution_model.json)

From Phase 7 onward, the single artifact is `solution_model.json`. Schema:

## Sections

- **concepts** — Array of concept objects. Each has: id, module, kind, inherits, summary, properties, operations, relationships, behavior_refs, story_refs, evidence_refs.
- **behaviors** — Array of behavior objects. Each has: id, name, owner, collaborators, linked_steps, story_refs, evidence_refs.
- **interaction_tree** — Object with epics array. Each epic has sub_epics; each sub_epic has stories. Each story has: id, name, actors, steps, scenarios. Each step has: id, name, linked_behaviors, trigger, response.
- **evidence_refs** — Registry: actions, decisions, states, relationships keyed by ID. Concepts and behaviors reference these IDs.

## Concept

```json
{
  "id": "Character",
  "module": "Core",
  "kind": "aggregate_root",
  "inherits": null,
  "summary": "The entity that performs actions.",
  "properties": [],
  "operations": [],
  "relationships": [{"type": "owns", "target": "AbilityScore", "cardinality": "1..*"}],
  "behavior_refs": ["beh_activate"],
  "story_refs": ["story_resolve_attack"],
  "evidence_refs": ["act_0042", "rel_0012"]
}
```

## Behavior

```json
{
  "id": "beh_activate",
  "name": "activate",
  "owner": "Character",
  "collaborators": ["Attack", "Effect"],
  "linked_steps": ["step_activate_attack"],
  "story_refs": ["story_resolve_attack"],
  "evidence_refs": ["act_0042", "dec_0001"]
}
```

## Step

Each step has at least one linked_behavior. Scenarios group steps (e.g. hit vs miss).

# Interaction Tree Format

# Interaction Tree Format

## Hierarchy

Epic → Sub-Epic → Story → Scenario → Step

| Node | Meaning | Heading |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Epic | Large domain capability — a major area of the system | `# Epic: <name> (<statement>)` |
| Sub-Epic | Logical grouping of related stories — a feature area, not a behavior itself | `## Epic: <name> (<statement>)` |
| Story | Smallest independently valuable behavior — has a triggering actor, a responding actor, and produces observable state change. If it has no actor and no state change, it is not a story. | `### Story: <name> (<statement>)` |
| Scenario | A condition-specific grouping of steps within a story (e.g. success path, failure path) | `#### Scenario: <name>` |
| Step | A single atomic interaction — one action by one actor | `- Step N: <name> (When/Then <statement>)` |

## Per Interaction

- **Trigger** — Triggering-Actor, Behavior
- **Response** — Responding-Actor, Behavior
- **Pre-Condition** — label only (Given/And)
- **Failure-Modes** — bullet list, max 3; rule/state based only (no infrastructure failures)
- **Domain Concepts** - Domain Concepts related to Interaction, must exist in the domain model
- **Examples** — tables per concept


### Commonly Generated Fields Per Node

| Node | Commonly Generated | Case-by-Case |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| Epic | Triggering-Actor, Responding-Actor, Name, Pre-Condition | Constraints |
| Story | Trigger, Response, Name, Examples, Pre-Condition, Failure-Modes | Constraints |
| Scenario | Trigger, Response, Pre-Condition, Examples | |
| Step | Trigger, Response, Examples | Constraints (when step-specific) |

## Domain Grounding

Use `**Concept**` in labels. Every concept must exist in Domain Model.

## Inheritance

Parent → child; use `[brackets]` for inherited values (e.g. `Triggering-Actor: [User]`).

## Example Tables

Tables live on the interaction. One per concept referenced in labels, should be identical to examples in the domain model

```
ConceptName (qualifier):
| scenario | field1 | field2 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| success  | val1   | val2   |

AnotherConcept (qualifier):
| scenario | field1 |
|----------|--------|
| success  | val1   |
```

- Qualifier in parentheses after concept name
- Scenario column required; use kebab-case (e.g. `success`, `invalid-details`)
- `===` separator between tables
- Inherited examples: `Examples: [Table Name 1, Table Name 2]`

## Validation Checklist

**Epic**
- [ ] Heading: `# Epic: <name using **Domain Concepts**> (<statement>)`
- [ ] Triggering-Actor, Responding-Actor, Pre-Condition, Examples present (or inherited)
- [ ] Pre-Condition on parent only when shared; children list only new or specialized state

**Story**
- [ ] Heading: `### Story: <name using **Domain Concepts**> (<statement>)`
- [ ] Pre-Condition, Failure-Modes (max 3), Trigger, Response present
- [ ] Trigger: sub-bullets Triggering-Actor, Behavior
- [ ] Response: sub-bullets Responding-Actor, Behavior

**Step**
- [ ] `- Step N: <name using **Domain Concepts**> (When/Then <statement>)`
- [ ] Trigger and Response with [inherited] when from parent

**Example tables**
- [ ] Qualifier in parentheses: `ConceptName (qualifier):`
- [ ] Scenario column required; kebab-case
- [ ] Each table: label, header row, separator row, data rows

**Hierarchy**
- [ ] Epic → Epic/Story → Scenario → Step
- [ ] Each node touches at least one domain concept via `**Concept**`

## Domain Model Rules (15)

Apply these rules when producing the domain model output for this phase.

---
title: Domain Model — Atomic Operations
impact: HIGH
---

## One Operation = One Behavior

**DO** keep Operations atomic: one Operation = one behavior.

**DO** describe behavior (Acquires, Releases, Calculates, Validates), not outcome (Prevents, Issues).

**DO NOT** pack multiple conditions into one Operation (e.g. "Releases on unlock, redemption complete, or timeout" → split into separate Operations).

**DO NOT** use outcome phrasing (Prevents, Issues) when behavior phrasing is clearer (Acquires, Releases).


---

---
title: Behavior Owns Decision
impact: HIGH
---

# Behavior Owns Decision

Place behavior on the object that owns the data needed for the decision. The information expert should own the rule.

**DO:** Assign decisions, validation, and rule enforcement to the object that holds the state needed to make the decision. If an object has properties, it should also have operations that use those properties.

Example (correct):
```
Account
- Number balance
- can_debit(amount) → balance >= amount
- debit(amount) → enforces invariant, updates balance
```

**DO NOT:** Split data from the logic that operates on it. Objects with properties but no meaningful operations are anemic — the decisions are elsewhere, typically in a service or manager.

Example (wrong):
```
Account
- Number balance
(no operations — debit logic lives in AccountService.debit(account, amount))

AccountService
- debit(account, amount) → checks account.balance >= amount, sets account.balance -= amount
```


---

---
title: Domain Model — Code Representation
impact: MEDIUM
---

## Align to Implementation

**DO** use concise concept names that could exist as types (Order, Portfolio, LineItem).

**DO** use typed Properties and Operations — actual type names (Money, Symbol, Quantity), not prose descriptions.

**DO NOT** use long prose sentences as concept names (e.g. "Collection of customer investments that aggregates all holdings...").

**DO NOT** use prose descriptions for Property or Operation types — use actual type names (e.g. `RiskScore, RiskModel, Holding`, not "detailed object containing volatility calculations").


---

---
title: No Generic Resolvers
impact: HIGH
---

# No Generic Resolvers

Generic resolver, handler, manager, or processor classes that route all behavior through one point are a sign of missing domain abstractions.

**DO:** Create specific domain objects for specific behaviors. If multiple types share a pattern, use polymorphism — each type owns its own behavior.

Example (correct):
```
WireTransfer
- validate() → validates SWIFT code, multi-day settlement rules
- execute() → executes wire-specific settlement

ACHTransfer
- validate() → validates routing number, batch rules
- execute() → executes ACH-specific settlement
```

**DO NOT:** Use generic "resolver" or "handler" classes that route all behavior through one point. These centralize decisions that should be distributed to domain objects.

Example (wrong):
```
TransferResolver
- resolve(type, data) → if type == "wire": ... elif type == "ach": ... elif ...
```


---

---
title: Thin Orchestration
impact: HIGH
---

# Thin Orchestration

Orchestration layers coordinate — they do not decide. Business logic belongs to the object that owns the data needed for the decision.

**DO:** Keep orchestrators thin — they sequence calls, pass messages, and handle lifecycle. Decisions, validation, and rule enforcement live on domain objects.

Example (correct):
```
PaymentProcessor (orchestration)
- process(payment) → delegates to payment.validate(), account.debit(), settlement.execute()

Payment (domain object)
- validate() → owns validation rules
- apply_fees() → owns fee calculation
```

**DO NOT:** Put business logic in orchestrators, managers, or handlers. If an orchestrator is making decisions about domain state, the decision belongs on the domain object instead.

Example (wrong):
```
PaymentProcessor (orchestration)
- process(payment) → checks payment.amount > 0, checks account.balance >= amount, calculates fees, applies discount rules
```


---

---
title: Traverse From Root
impact: HIGH
---

## Traverse From Root

**DO** traverse from root. The source owns creation; the created object receives the source and derives the value internally. Do not pass raw derived values.

**DO NOT** pass raw values when the source object is available.

- Example (wrong): `validation.resolve(source.value)`
- Example (correct): `validation = source.create_validation(dc)` then `validation.resolve()` — validation gets value from source internally.


---

---
title: Derive from context
impact: HIGH
---

## Derive from context

**DO** derive concepts from the interactions you find in the context; focus on *who* exchanges *what* and *what must be true before and after*.
- Example (right): Context says "Customer adds to cart" → interaction: Add to Cart; concepts: Shopping Cart, LineItem. Context says "User selects country for payment" → interaction: Select Country; concepts: Country, PaymentType.

**DO NOT** invent workflows or mechanics not present in the context.
- Example (wrong): Story "Express checkout" or concept "LoyaltyPoints" when context never mentions them. Right: Omit; if needed, state assumption.


---

---
title: Mechanics from evidence, not table of contents
impact: HIGH
---

## Mechanics from evidence, not table of contents

**DO** read evidence chunks for mechanical depth. For each candidate subtype, scan actions.json and terms.json for that name. Derive properties, operations, and collaborators from what the evidence says that variant does. A subtype is justified when the evidence describes different rules, formulas, state transitions, or interaction patterns.

**DO** verify each subtype has its own trigger, conditions, or resolution path in the source. Different mechanics = subtype. Same mechanics with different label = enum.

**DO NOT** infer subtypes from chapter titles, section headers, or bullet lists without reading the actual rule text. A table of contents that lists "Volume Discount, Loyalty Reward, Bundle Offer" under Promotions does not make them subtypes — only the rules for each do.

**DO NOT** create subtypes from variation axes or category lists when each item shares the same resolution logic. "Transaction types: Purchase, Return, Exchange" in a summary is a categorization; read the rules to see if each resolves differently.

- Example (wrong): Source has section "Transaction Types" with Purchase, Return, Exchange. You list those as subtypes. But the ToC categories are wrong — the mechanics show different resolution types (e.g. forward payment vs reversal vs disputed reversal). Right: Read the rules. Derive subtypes from resolution mechanics, not from ToC labels.
- Example (wrong): Source lists "Payment Methods: Credit Card, Bank Transfer, Invoice" and you model each as a subtype because they use different rails. But the mechanics are identical — same flow, different input. Right: PaymentMethod with `method_type {credit_card, bank_transfer, invoice}` — data field, not subtypes. Same mechanics with different input = variable, not subtype.


---

---
title: Subtypes vs enum — distinct mechanics required
impact: HIGH
---

## Subtypes vs enum — distinct mechanics required

**DO** use subtype when the evidence shows different properties, operations, or resolution mechanics for each variant. A subtype is a concept when it has its own rules — different validation, different settlement, different formulas, different state transitions.

**DO** use enum (or type property) when variants share the same logic and differ only by label. Same behavior, different data = enum. Format: `EnumType property_name {value1, value2, value3}`.

**DO NOT** derive subtypes from table of contents or section headers alone. Verify each subtype has distinct mechanics in the evidence (actions.json, terms.json, context chunks). If the source only lists names under a category without different rules per name, it's an enum.

**DO NOT** create both a parent "Type" or "Category" enum and subtypes that mirror it. Example (wrong): Transaction has `TransactionType type {purchase, refund, chargeback}` AND subtypes Purchase, Refund, Chargeback. Use one representation: either enum or subtypes with genuinely different mechanics.

- Example (right — subtype): Transaction subtypes Purchase, Refund, Chargeback — each has different validation, settlement, and reversal rules. Purchase: forward payment, creates obligation. Refund: reversal, requires original. Chargeback: disputed reversal, involves issuer. Each gets its own concept.
- Example (right — enum): Order has `OrderStatus status {pending, shipped, delivered}` — same state machine, different state. Or: LineItem has `ItemType type {product, service, subscription}` — same line-item logic, different label.
- Example (wrong): Transaction types Purchase, Return, Exchange as Transaction subtypes when the rules treat them the same way and only categorize by label. Right: `TransactionType type {purchase, return, exchange}` on Transaction.
- Example (wrong): Subtypes inferred from a bullet list "Promotions: Volume Discount, Loyalty Reward, Bundle Offer..." without reading whether each has different mechanics. Right: Read the actual rule text; if Volume Discount has tier-based calc, Loyalty Reward has points logic, Bundle has bundle rules, they're subtypes. If they're just names under a category, enum.


---

---
title: Hierarchy from evidence, not invention
impact: HIGH
---

## Build concept_hierarchy from evidence

**DO** derive parent-child relationships from evidence in `registries.actions` and concept `performs`/`receives`:
- **Shared mechanics** — concepts that share the same resolution, cost, or validation role (e.g. Wire Transfer, ACH, Card Payment all resolve as Payment; Checking, Savings, Money Market → Account) → Child → Parent
- **Shared protocol** — concepts that participate in the same workflow, lifecycle, or parent's collection → introduce a common base
- **Subtype patterns** — when evidence describes different rules, formulas, or state transitions for variants → model as Child : Parent

**DO** scan actions for each concept: subject, object, predicate, raw. Look for:
- Co-occurrence (concepts that appear together as subject/object)
- Shared terminology (term_ids, chunk_ids overlap)
- Domain language (e.g. "Transaction", "Account", "Payment", "Fee", "Product", "Order" in raw text)

**DO** build a **comprehensive** hierarchy. With hundreds of concepts, expect many parent types: Transaction, Account, Payment, Fee, Product, Order, Customer, etc. Each parent should have all its subtypes listed.

**DO NOT** infer hierarchy from chapter titles, section headers, or ToC alone. Read the raw action text to confirm different mechanics.

**DO NOT** leave hierarchy sparse. If you have 10+ concepts that share mechanics (e.g. Wire Transfer, ACH, Card Payment → Payment; Checking, Savings → Account), add them. If you have Transaction subtypes beyond Purchase/Refund/Chargeback, add them.

**Related rules:** [concept-model-subtypes-first-class](concept-model-subtypes-first-class.md), [variation-base-inheritance](variation-base-inheritance.md), [domain-mechanics-not-toc](domain-mechanics-not-toc.md), [refined-integrate-concepts](refined-integrate-concepts.md).


---

---
title: Model Instances, Not Smashed Properties
impact: HIGH
---

## Model Instances, Not Smashed Properties

**DO** consider when a concept is best represented as instances/examples (objects in diagram) vs smashing it into a property or method.

**DO** model context with tables as one or more concepts with relationships.

**DO** model instances and examples explicitly when structure matters.

**DO NOT** smash complex objects with multiple concepts into a single property or method.


---

---
title: Domain Model — Standard Types for Properties
impact: HIGH
---

## Standard Types for Properties

**DO** use standard types for Properties when defining concepts:

| Type | Use when | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **String** | Text, names, labels | `Customer.name`, `Product.sku` |
| **Number** | Quantities, amounts, counts | `Cart.total`, `LineItem.quantity` |
| **Boolean** | Yes/no, flags | `Order.isPaid`, `Cart.isEmpty` |
| **List** | Ordered collection | `Cart.lineItems` (List of LineItem) |
| **Dictionary** | Key-value mapping | `Product.attributes`, `Config.settings` |
| **UniqueID** | Identifier, reference | `Order.customerId`, `LineItem.productId` |
| **Instant** | Point in time (ISO 8601) | `Order.createdAt`, `Payment.processedAt` |

| **EnumType** | Fixed set of valid values | `ModifierType type {bonus, penalty}`, `ActionType action_type {standard, move, free, reaction}` |

Use `List<T>` or `Dictionary<K,V>` when element types matter.

**DO** use a named enum type when a property has a constrained set of valid values. Format: `EnumType property_name {value1, value2, value3}`.

**DO NOT** use `String` with parenthetical options (e.g., `String type (bonus/penalty)`). Strings imply free-form text; constrained options are a distinct type.

- Example (wrong): `String type (bonus/penalty)`, `String attack_type (close/ranged)`.
- Example (right): `ModifierType type {bonus, penalty}`, `AttackType attack_type {close, ranged}`.


---

---
title: Speculation and assumptions
impact: HIGH
---

## Speculation and assumptions

**DO** state an assumption when something is unclear.
- Example (right): "Assumption: Shipping Address is provided before checkout"; "Assumption: Loyalty points not in scope".

**DO NOT** speculate beyond the provided material or invent mechanics when unclear.
- Example (wrong): Story "Apply loyalty points at checkout" when context never mentions loyalty. Right: Omit, or state "Assumption: Loyalty points not in scope."


---

---
title: Subtypes as first-class concepts
impact: HIGH
---

## Subtypes as first-class concepts

**DO** give each subtype its own `### **SubtypeName** : Parent` section with its own properties, operations, collaborators, and composition. Subtypes inherit from parent but have distinct mechanics — model those mechanics explicitly.

**DO** ground each subtype's definition in evidence. Scan `actions.json` and `terms.json` for the subtype name (e.g. Purchase, Refund, Chargeback) and derive properties/operations from what the evidence says that subtype does.

**DO NOT** list subtypes only in a parent's `Subtypes:` line without creating first-class sections for them.

**DO NOT** collapse subtypes that have distinct rules (e.g. Purchase vs Refund vs Chargeback each have different validation, settlement, reversal) into a single parent definition.

- Example (wrong): `### **Transaction**` with `Subtypes: Purchase, Refund, Chargeback` and no separate sections for Purchase, Refund, Chargeback.
- Example (right): `### **Transaction**` plus `### **Purchase** : Transaction`, `### **Refund** : Transaction`, `### **Chargeback** : Transaction`, etc., each with its own properties, operations, and collaborators.


---

---
title: Subtypes vs enum — verify before modeling
impact: HIGH
---

## Subtypes vs enum — verify before modeling

**DO** before creating a subtype section: verify actions.json and terms.json show different mechanics for that subtype. Different properties, operations, or resolution paths = subtype. Same logic, different label = enum on parent.

**DO** use `EnumType property_name {value1, value2}` when the evidence shows same behavior across variants. Do not create subtype sections for enum-like variation.

**DO NOT** create subtype sections from concept_hierarchy without evidence check. If concept_guidance listed Purchase, Refund, Chargeback as Transaction subtypes but the evidence treats them identically (same validation, same settlement flow), convert to `TransactionType type {purchase, refund, chargeback}` on Transaction.

**DO NOT** have both a type enum and mirroring subtypes. If Transaction has `TransactionType type {purchase, refund, chargeback}`, do not also create Purchase, Refund, Chargeback as subtypes.

- Example (right): Transaction has Purchase, Refund, Chargeback as subtypes — evidence shows Purchase has forward-payment validation, Refund has reversal rules and original-required check, Chargeback has issuer workflow. Each has distinct mechanics.
- Example (wrong): Transaction has Purchase, Return, Exchange as subtypes when the rules only categorize by label. Right: Transaction with `TransactionType type {purchase, return, exchange}`.

## Interaction Tree Rules (9)

Apply these rules when producing the interaction tree output for this phase.

---
title: Verb-noun format
impact: HIGH
order: 1
---

## Verb-noun format

Use verb-noun format for epic/story/step names and steps. Actor documented separately. Use active voice, base verb forms, and business language for all interaction text. Use behavioral language — describe what happens, not how it's implemented. Use domain concepts in steps (Given/When/Then) — not UI labels. Applies to all nodes (epic, story, step, scenario), including steps in or out of scenarios.
**DO** use Actor → verb noun [qualifiers]. Actor is documented separately, NOT in the name.
- Names: "Places Order" (actor: Customer); "Validates Payment" (actor: System); "Process Order Payment".
- **Step format** — strategy may specify When/Then (strict) or vanilla (verb-noun). Show both:
  - **When/Then:** `When **User** browses countries; Then **System** displays list of **Country** options`.
  - **Vanilla:** `User submits form`, `System validates payment`, `Select item from list`.
- Use base verb forms (infinitive/imperative): "Select Tokens", "Group Minions", "Process Payment".
- Use behavioral terms: "When user enters name; Then system saves character information" (not "system writes to JSON").
- Use domain concepts in steps: "User selects **Country**", "User enters **PaymentDetails**" (not "User clicks dropdown", "User fills form field").

**DO NOT** include actor in name, use noun-only, gerunds, or third-person singular.
**DO NOT** use technical implementation terms (config, json, api, sql, class, method). Use behavioral language instead.
- Wrong: "Customer Places Order" (actor in name). Right: "Places Order" (actor: Customer).
- Wrong: "Order submission", "Payment processing", "Form validation" (noun-only). Right: "Submit order", "Process payment", "Validate form".
- Wrong: "Submitting order", "Selects item", "Displays confirmation" (gerund/third-person). Right: "Submit order", "Select item", "Display confirmation".
- Wrong: "Then system saves to JSON file", "Then system parses XML", "Then system executes SQL query" (technical). Right: "Then system saves configuration data", "Then system processes data", "Then system retrieves data".
- Wrong: "User clicks dropdown", "User fills form field", "User submits button" (UI). Right: "User selects **Country**", "User enters **PaymentDetails**", "User submits payment".


---

---
title: Outcome-oriented language
impact: HIGH
order: 2
---

## Outcome-oriented language

Use outcome-oriented language over mechanism-oriented language. Focus on what is created or achieved, not how it's shown or communicated.

**DO** use verbs that describe artifacts and outcomes — name concepts by what they ARE or CREATE.
- Example (right): "System → displays power activation animation" (not "Visualizing Power Activation"); "System → provides combat outcome feedback" (not "Showing Combat Results"); "System → displays hit indicators" (not "Displaying Hit Information").

**DO NOT** use generic communication or mechanism verbs.
- Example (wrong): "Visualizing Power Activation", "Showing Combat Results", "Displaying Hit Information", "Presenting Configuration Options".
- Wrong: "Showing results", "Displaying information", "Visualizing data", "Presenting options", "Providing settings", "Enabling features", "Allowing access".


---

---
title: Hierarchy — approximately 4 to 9 children
impact: MEDIUM
order: 3
---

## Hierarchy — approximately 4 to 9 children

Any node (epic, story, scenario) has approximately 4–9 children. Does not apply to steps. For stories, count **steps** as children (not scenarios).
**DO** keep child count in the 4–9 range for manageable granularity.
- Epic: ~4–9 sub-epics or stories.
- Story: ~4–9 steps (total across scenarios; scenarios are containers, not counted).
- Scenario: ~4–9 steps.

**DO NOT** create nodes with many more than 9 children — split or regroup.
- Wrong: Epic with 15 stories (split into sub-epics).
- Wrong: Story with 12 steps (consider splitting story or grouping steps into scenarios).


---

---
title: Story granularity
impact: MEDIUM-HIGH
order: 4
---

## Story granularity

**DO** break down by distinct requirements areas, distinct concept structure, or workflow steps; sufficient stories to capture rule detail.
- Example (right): Story "View Product Details", Story "Make Payment" (each has distinct logic). Story "Drive Bike", Story "Drive Car" (concept structure differs).

**DO NOT** collapse large rule sections into one story.
- Example (wrong): Story "All combat effects" or "All attack types" when the context has dozens of distinct rules. Right: Story "Apply damage effect", Story "Apply condition effect", Story "Resolve melee attack", etc.


---

---
title: Small and testable
impact: HIGH
order: 5
---

## Small and testable

Stories must be testable as complete interactions and deliverable independently. Story = testable outcome; Step = implementation detail.

**DO** create stories that can be tested and delivered independently.
- Example (right): "Customer → places order" (testable: order created, payment processed).
- Story = User/system outcome (testable independently with clear acceptance criteria).
- Step = Implementation detail (not testable alone, verified as part of parent story test).

**DO NOT** create stories too small to test meaningfully or make implementation steps into stories.
- Example (wrong): "Add order button" (can't test without full order flow); "Display error message" (can't test without validation context).
- Wrong: "Convert Diagram to StoryGraph Format", "Serialize Components to JSON", "Calculate Component Positions" (implementation steps, not testable alone).

## Alternate actors in steps

Alternate between actors every 1–2 steps. Scenarios should show back-and-forth interaction between user and system.

**DO** alternate actors every 1–2 steps to show interaction flow.
- Actor acts, system responds: `User submits order → System validates payment`
- System completes, actor reacts: `System displays confirmation → User reviews details`
- System can chain 1–2 sequential actions before returning to actor: `User submits form → System validates input → System saves data → System displays result → User confirms`

**DO NOT** have more than 2 consecutive steps from the same actor without switching.
- Example (wrong): `System validates → System processes → System stores → System notifies` — too many consecutive system steps
- Example (wrong): `User enters name → User enters email → User enters password → User clicks submit` — should have system validation between steps

## Keep acceptance criteria consistent across connected domains

At small scale, AC can cover multiple domain objects together. As domain objects develop distinct behavior, keep AC consistent in structure across connected domains. AC crossing multiple domain behaviors is a signal to split the story.

**DO** at small scale keep AC together. As you scale, scope AC to one domain and keep structure consistent.
- At small scale, AC covering multiple domain objects together is acceptable: `User submits payment → System validates and routes` — covering wire and ACH together is fine when each has simple, similar validation
- As domain objects develop distinct behavior, scope AC to one domain: `User submits wire payment → System validates intermediary bank and routes to wire rail` — one payment type, one flow
- Keep AC consistent in structure across connected domains: wire and ACH stories both follow the same pattern with domain-specific details as the only variation
- AC crossing multiple domains is the signal to split the story: if an AC mentions both wire validation AND ACH routing, split into two stories

**DO NOT** write AC that mixes domain behaviors or write inconsistent AC across connected domains.
- Example (wrong): `User submits payment → System validates wire rules AND ACH rules AND check rules` — too broad when each has distinct validation
- Example (wrong): Wire story has 5 detailed AC covering every validation step, ACH story has 1 vague AC — keep the depth and structure parallel

title: Sequential order
impact: HIGH

## Sequential order

**DO** order the tree sequentially — required state creators before consumers; follow actual flow, not topic grouping.
- Example (right): Create Character → Set Scenario → Start Turn → Perform Action.

**DO NOT** organize by topic when it violates sequence.
- Example (wrong): "All checks together" or "Run Combat" before "Create Character" or "Set Scenario". Right: Create Character → Set Scenario → Start Turn → Perform Action.

title: Use And and But for conditions

## Use And and But for conditions

Use **And** for multiple system reactions to one event; use **But** for negative conditions and constraints. Applies to Trigger/Response and steps.
**DO** use And when listing multiple reactions or conditions.
- Right: "Then **System** validates payment **and** displays confirmation".
- Right: "When **User** selects **Country** and **PaymentType**; Then **System** displays form".

**DO** use But for negative conditions and constraints.
- Right: "When **User** has no **Session**; Then **System** redirects to login".
- Right: "**User** has **PaymentType** access **but** not for this **Country**".

**DO NOT** chain positives with But or use And for contrasting conditions.
- Wrong: "Then system validates but displays error" (use And for multiple outcomes, or split into separate steps).
- Wrong: "User has access and not for country" (use But for the negative).
