## Base and Inheritance Check

### Concepts that share structure — should they extend a common base?

**Check each cluster** for shared protocol and shared invariants. When concepts share:
- (a) amount or currency mechanics
- (b) participation in validation (e.g. threshold caps)
- (c) lifecycle (created/processed during workflow)
- (d) membership in a parent's collection

…then a common base may be appropriate. Shared protocol: `amount()`, participation in validation, contribution to totals.

**Look for:**
- Missing base — concepts that share acquisition, cost, and validation role but lack a common supertype
- Over-inheritance — base with no real semantics; subtypes share only fields, not behavior

**Verdict:** Introduce a base when the *role* is the same and variation is in implementation. Avoid over-bias against inheritance when concepts clearly share protocol and invariants.

**DO NOT** defer to future refinement. When concepts share protocol (cost, acquisition, validation role, lifecycle, membership in a parent's collection), introduce the shared base in the current phase. Do not say "consider base in future refinement" when the protocol is shared now.

**AI must propose minimal corrections** (e.g. add FinancialRecord as base for Invoice, LineItem, Payment).
