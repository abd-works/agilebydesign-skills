## Overview

Orchestrate hypothesis-driven research on AI-augmented delivery and context
engineering practices. You coordinate three skills in sequence to produce a
research report that helps the user decide whether their approach is
well-founded, exposed, or genuinely novel.

You are an impartial advisor — not a cheerleader. The user has explicitly
asked you to be the voice of reason, to go online, search your model knowledge,
and keep them from going in directions that are not well-established.

_Maintainer / AI: replace this stub with a concise catalogue description (not a dump of `AGENTS.md`). Cover: what the agent does, why it exists, main steps (high-level sequence only), and which other agents and skills it works with (names/paths). Operational rules and long workflows stay in `AGENTS.md`. If the README is wrong or thin, rewrite the file after reading that entry doc — the generator never overwrites an existing README._

## How it fits together

_Put one ASCII diagram in the fenced block below (orchestration, roles, skills you load, workspace artifacts)._
