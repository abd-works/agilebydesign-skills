# Delivery stages

Canonical stage definitions for the delivery lead and team members. Source of truth for entry conditions, exit gates, practice skills, and team roles per slot.

**Bootcamp reference:** [AI-Augmented Delivery Bootcamp — Five Families × Five Stages](https://forge.abdworks.net/abd-ai-augmented-bootcamp/#/22/1)

## Stages (bootcamp order)

| # | Stage | File | Follow-on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Shaping** | [shaping.md](shaping.md) | → [discovery.md](discovery.md) |
| 2 | **Discovery** | [discovery.md](discovery.md) | → [exploration.md](exploration.md) |
| 3 | **Exploration** | [exploration.md](exploration.md) | → [specification.md](specification.md) |
| 4 | **Specification** | [specification.md](specification.md) | → [engineering.md](engineering.md) |
| 5 | **Engineering** | [engineering.md](engineering.md) | → next increment / [discovery.md](discovery.md) refresh |

## Skill families (default executor role)

Four **families** organize packages under `skills/`. Each has a **default** executor role — stage files override when cross-family (see [team-roles.md](../roles/team-roles.md)).

| Family | Default role | Playbook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Story-driven delivery** | Product Owner | [product-owner.md](../roles/product-owner.md) |
| **Domain-driven design** | Business Expert | [business-expert.md](../roles/business-expert.md) |
| **User experience design** | UX Designer | [ux-designer.md](../roles/ux-designer.md) |
| **Architecture & engineering** | Engineer | [engineer.md](../roles/engineer.md) |

Role index: [team-roles.md](../roles/team-roles.md)

## Cross-artifact updates

Any output in one family can force an update in another. After each slot, the delivery lead checks ripple triggers before opening the next slot:

| When this changes… | Review / update… |
| --- | --- |
| Domain terms, UL, CRC, object model | Story map labels, AC, scenarios, architecture component names |
| Story map (add/rename/split stories) | Domain terms, IA screen lists, slice assignments, AC scope |
| UX IA or mockups | AC (interaction-level), interface design, story coverage on screens |
| Architecture blueprint / template / reference | Domain boundaries, test layout, module structure, SLOs |
| AC or scenarios | Mockups, CRC, tests, code |

Log conflicts in `docs/corrections-log.md`; do not advance the slot until assigned ripple updates are scoped or waived at checkpoint.

## Layered context (bootcamp)

| Scope | Depth |
| --- | --- |
| Whole solution | wide / shallow — Shaping, Discovery |
| Increment | medium — Exploration, Specification |
| Sprint / story | narrow → narrowest / deep — Engineering |
