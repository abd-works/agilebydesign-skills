## Notes

- Delivery lead agent writes this after operator approves the agile delivery plan.
- **Progress:** `delivery-plan-checklist.md` in this folder (generated from `agile-delivery-plan.md`); slot completion = `slot-NN-finished.md`.
- `run_sizing_policy` is updated by the lead after each run; later runs follow the updated policy in `manifest.md`.
- Operator can override runs upfront; lead documents overrides with rationale.
- Slot definitions are added one at a time as the prior slot finishes.
