# Acceptance criteria (exploration)  

<!-- Template migrated from agile_bots story_bot exploration behavior conventions. -->  

For each **story**, list **acceptance_criteria** as behavioral outcomes using **WHEN / THEN / AND** (and **BUT** for negative outcomes). Reserve **Given** for **scenarios** (BDD), not for AC in `story-graph.json`.  

**Source traceability (required when AC are grounded in a corpus):** For **every** numbered acceptance criterion, record **where** that behavior came from—use whatever the source provides: **chapter**, **section** / heading, **page** (or page range), **paragraph** number or quoted lead-in, **slide** number, **line** range, **timestamp**, stable **URL + anchor**, or **chunk / evidence id** (e.g. from a memory pipeline). One criterion may cite **multiple** locations if it synthesizes several passages. If there is **no** written source (facilitator call, whiteboard only), state that explicitly with **date and channel** so the chain is still honest.  

In **Markdown**, wrap **domain-significant** nouns and short phrases in *italics* — *Title Case* for multi-word concepts (e.g. *Report UI*, *Wire Transfer*). Italicize terms that belong to *your* problem space, not filler or whole sentences. See the skill rule **Emphasize domain-significant terms**.  

## Story: `Verb–Noun Title`  

**Story type:** user | system | technical  

### Domain terms  

List the **domain terms** this story’s AC rely on: words or short phrases for key **things**, **state**, **actions**, and **rules or constraints** in *your* problem space. Use *italics* for each term (*Title Case* for multi-word concepts); add a short dash or colon and a plain-language gloss so readers share one vocabulary before they read WHEN/THEN.  

**Illustrative pattern:**  

- *Operator* — human role performing the import    
- *Settlement File* — uploaded input; subject of validation    
- *Report UI* — surface where import and preview run    
- *Import Job* — asynchronous work unit; queued or discarded    
- *Filtered Report Rows* — preview content before commit    
- *Export Job Progress* — visible status (*Running*, etc.)    
- *Settlement Records* — persisted outcome after confirmation    
- *Schema Validation* / *Validation Error* — rule gate and failure shape    

Keep the list **lean** (only terms that appear in or anchor the AC below). The paired `.txt` file uses the **same words** without markdown.  

### Acceptance criteria  

**Illustrative pattern** (replace names and flows with your domain; keep the *italic* convention for domain terms). Each item ends with **Evidence** pointing back to the source:  

1. **WHEN** *Operator* submits *Settlement File* in *Report UI*    
   **THEN** *Import Job* queues and *Filtered Report Rows* appear in the preview    
   **AND** *Export Job Progress* shows *Running*    
   **BUT** *Settlement Records* are not committed until *Operator* confirms    
   **Evidence:** *Enterprise Reporting Requirements.pdf* — Ch. 4 “Settlement import”, pp. 12–13, paragraphs 3–4    

**Variant (delta only — atomic rule):**  

2. **WHEN** *Settlement File* fails *Schema Validation*    
   **THEN** *Import Job* stops with *Validation Error* summary    
   **Evidence:** *Enterprise Reporting Requirements.pdf* — Ch. 4, p. 14, §“Invalid file handling”; *API Spec* v2, p. 6, Table 2    
   *(Avoid repeating the same WHEN/THEN/AND block across multiple AC — see atomic AC rule.)*  

**Negative / error path:**  

3. **WHEN** *Operator* cancels during preview    
   **THEN** queued *Import Job* is discarded    
   **BUT** no *Settlement Records* are written    
   **Evidence:** *UX Review notes.docx* — Section “Preview cancel”, p. 2, bullet 2    

**Optional layout:** If inline **Evidence** lines feel noisy, you may instead add a **Source evidence** table **immediately after** the AC list for that story, with one row per AC # and the same citation detail:  

| AC # | Source (document / system) | Location |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| 1 | *Enterprise Reporting Requirements.pdf* | Ch. 4, pp. 12–13, paragraphs 3–4 |  
| 2 | *Enterprise Reporting Requirements.pdf*; *API Spec* v2 | p. 14 §“Invalid file…”; p. 6 Table 2 |  
| 3 | *UX Review notes.docx* | §“Preview cancel”, p. 2 |

## Instructions (template reference only — omit from generated files)  

- Target roughly **4–9** WHEN/THEN-style steps worth of coverage per story (mechanical count uses WHEN + AND lines in combined AC text).  
- Use **behavioral** language (user and system outcomes), not implementation (no file formats, APIs, class names) unless framed as `story_type: technical` and kept minimal.  
- Prefer **channel-specific** detail where the product has distinct CLI vs Panel vs API surfaces (concrete examples, quoted labels, `cli.` paths).  
- **Alternate** user and system steps; avoid long runs of the same actor without switching.  
- For **multiple system reactions** in sequence, chain with **AND** rather than a new **WHEN** for each micro-step (unless a genuinely new trigger).  
- **Domain terms:** per story, include **Domain terms** before **Acceptance criteria**; align the list with what appears in the AC. In `.md`, *italicize* terms in that list and inside AC lines; `.txt` uses the same words with no asterisks.  
- **Source evidence:** every numbered AC must have traceability (inline **Evidence:** or a per-story table). Prefer the **most specific** pointer the source allows (page + section + paragraph over “chapter 4” alone).
