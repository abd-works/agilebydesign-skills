## Overview

Track multi-step work with markdown checkboxes (- [ ] / - [x]) for any skill or agent—pipeline phases, per-phase steps, or ad-hoc lists—under the engagement workspace, without editing normative skill sources.

_Maintainer / AI: expand this section; it becomes the HTML **Description**. If the whole README is still a stub or wrong, replace the file after reading `SKILL.md` — the generator never overwrites an existing README. `SKILL.md` stays authoritative for behaviour._

## How it fits together

_Put one ASCII diagram in the fenced block below (flow, triggers, artifacts). The catalogue renders this block literally in a `<pre>`._

```ascii
agent + workspace
           |
           v
  checklist markdown -----> per-turn updates -----> progress visible on disk
```
