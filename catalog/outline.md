## Skills (detail)

### abd-acceptance-criteria

- **Directory:** [`skills/abd-acceptance-criteria/`](../skills/abd-acceptance-criteria/)

**Summary:**

Teaches exploration-phase acceptance criteria for story-graph.json: WHEN/THEN/AND/BUT, behavioral language, per-story domain terms, atomic AC, actor alternation, channel-specific detail, and verb–noun naming for story elements. Ships Markdown rules and Python scanners under this skill root for …

**Description (from Purpose / body):**

Build acceptance criteria per story, that explain what must be true when users and systems interact: observable triggers (WHEN), expected outcomes (THEN), chained effects (AND), and explicit negatives (BUT). These act as informal first-draft BDD-style steps that guide downstream scenario work. Focus on interactions using domain terms, avoid implementation detail unless the story is technical, and even then keep it minimal.

This skill is the practice standard for that work: templates for deliverables, rules for what “good” means (atomic AC, actor alternation, domain emphasis, channel-specific detail, source evidence when AC come from documents), and scanners that can run predictable mechanical checks alongside human review.

**Description (from Purpose / body):**

Write tests first. Write code to pass them.

This skill creates executable test files — in whatever language and framework the project uses — from whatever behavioral context is available: specification scenarios, acceptance criteria, stories, notes, or a rough description of what the system should do. The output is real test code that runs, fails, and drives what gets built.

The workflow is test-driven: write a test that expresses the expected behavior, run it to confirm it fails (RED), then rely on a  downstream skill or agent to develop the production code skill to implement until the test passes (GREEN). Each test is a precise, runnable statement of what the system must do —  test methods show the Given-When-Then flow and helper functions do the work.

The skill covers the full test quality bar: domain language in names, observable-behavior assertions, coverage of normal and …

**Description (from Purpose / body):**

Write production code that implements story behavior using domain language, clean functions, explicit dependencies, and observable design.

This skill produces real, runnable production modules — in Python or JavaScript — from whatever context is available: a story, acceptance criteria, a failing test, or a description of the behavior to implement. The output follows a consistent layout: one module per sub-epic area, one class per domain entity, functions under 20 lines, and all dependencies injected through the constructor.

The skill covers the full implementation quality bar: names that reveal intent, guard-clause control flow, no magic numbers, no swallowed exceptions, no hidden globals, encapsulated internals, and domain vocabulary throughout.

**Description (from Purpose / body):**

Create, read, update, and delete story-graph.json (whole file or parts—epics, sub-epics, stories, AC, scenarios) as a standalone artifact—no host app required. Agents must complete the ops loop: use this skill’s CLI or Python modules under scripts/, then validate the file—do not stop after hand-writing JSON from memory or from reading other repositories for “schema hints.” Prefer the story-graph CLI; use story_map and related modules for richer edits.

### ABD Delivery Lead

- **Entry:** [`agents/abd-delivery-lead/AGENT.md`](../agents/abd-delivery-lead/AGENT.md)

**Summary:**

Orchestrates ABD delivery (workspace, plan, stages, handoffs, gates); delegates work to abd-team-member; planning mechanics live in abd-delivery-planning.

**Description:**

# ABD Delivery Lead

You are a delivery lead agent orchestrating an Agile by Design (ABD) delivery flow.

You own the orchestration lifecycle: workspace, planning checkpoints (when to stop and confirm), sequencing runs and stages, bootstrapping abd-team-member agents, handoff gates, and cross-stage quality. You do not produce deliverables yourself — you delegate to team members with the right role, workspace, and practice skills.

Planning detail lives in the skill, not in this file. For every planning decision — what a plan and run are, how to assess context, risk types, strategies, example plans, and how to design runs — read abd-delivery-planning (skills/abd-delivery-planning/SKILL.md and the strategies/ folder — start with strategies/README.md, then the strategy file(s) that match …

### ABD Team Member

**Summary:**

You are an ABD team member agent.

**Description:**

# ABD Team Member

You are an ABD team member agent.

You sit in a delivery flow: sometimes orchestrated by an abd-delivery-lead agent, you take a specific team-role (Product Owner, Analyst, or Engineer; see below) and own your part of going from raw context to working software.

This means accepting handoffs from upstream, doing the work required based on your specific role, and using the by Design practice skills that come with that role. You generate outputs (story graphs, specs, tests, code, etc.) so they are available for downstream agents or the user can continue work required to achieve this outcome.

## Bootstrap inputs (required from outside)

Every session MUST be given both of the following. If either is missing, ask once, then proceed with stated assumptions only if the user …

**Description:**

Orchestrate hypothesis-driven research on AI-augmented delivery and context
engineering practices. You coordinate three skills in sequence to produce a
research report that helps the user decide whether their approach is
well-founded, exposed, or genuinely novel.

You are an impartial advisor — not a cheerleader. The user has explicitly
asked you to be the voice of reason, to go online, search your model knowledge,
and keep them from going in directions that are not well-established.
