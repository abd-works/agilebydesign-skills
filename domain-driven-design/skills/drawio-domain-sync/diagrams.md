# Class Diagrams

When a run produces or modifies domain model concepts, render the changes to a DrawIO class diagram. One page per foundational model. The diagram is the visual representation of `domain-model.md` — they stay in sync.

## Diagram File

**Path:** `<session>/class diagram.drawio` (alongside `domain-model.md`)

Each foundational model section in `domain-model.md` maps to one page in the diagram. Page names must match section names exactly (e.g., "Resolution System", "Combat System").

## When to Render

- **After producing domain model output** in a run — render new/changed concepts to the diagram
- **After corrections that change domain model** — update the diagram to match
- **After user edits the diagram in DrawIO** — sync back to `domain-model.md` using `sync-to-model`

## Tools

All tools are in `scripts/` in the synthesizer skill. Run from that directory.

```bash
cd skills/abd-story-synthesizer/scripts
python drawio_class_cli.py <command> <drawio-file> [options]
```

### Diagram Management

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `init` | `init <file> --page <name>` — create file or add page |
| `inspect` | `inspect <file> [--page <name>]` — JSON: classes, edges, overlaps |
| `sync-to-model` | `sync-to-model <file> [--page <name>] [--model <md-path>]` — sync diagram classes back to domain-model.md with diffs |

### Class CRUD

| Command | Usage |
|---------|-------|
| `add-class` | `add-class <file> --page <page> --name <Name> [--base <Base>] [--props "p1\|p2"] [--ops "o1\|o2"] [--invs "i1\|i2"] [--x N] [--y N]` |
| `update-class` | `update-class <file> --page <page> --name <Name> --add-prop "..." \| --remove-prop "..." \| --add-op "..." \| --remove-op "..." \| --add-inv "..." \| --set-base <Base>` |
| `delete-class` | `delete-class <file> --page <page> --name <Name>` — removes class and all its edges |
| `move` | `move <file> --page <page> --name <Name> --x N --y N` |

### Relationship CRUD

| Command | Style | Usage |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `add-inheritance` | Hollow triangle (straight or orthogonal) | `--child <Child> --parent <Parent> [--orthogonal]` |
| `add-composition` | Filled diamond on owner (orthogonal) | `--owner <Owner> --part <Part> [--straight]` |
| `add-aggregation` | Hollow diamond on owner (orthogonal) | `--owner <Owner> --part <Part> [--straight]` |
| `add-association` | Open arrow (orthogonal) | `--from <Source> --to <Target> [--straight]` |
| `add-dependency` | Dashed open arrow (straight) | `--from <Source> --to <Target> [--label <text>]` |
| `delete-edge` | — | `--from <Source> --to <Target>` |

## Layout Guidelines

- **Inheritance:** Base on top, extensions below. Straight vertical lines preferred when parent and child are in the same column. Use `inheritance-orthogonal` when the child is in a different column from the parent — straight diagonal lines cut through intervening classes.
- **Composition/aggregation:** Orthogonal routing (right-angle corners). Diamond on the owner (parent) side.
- **Association:** Orthogonal routing. Use `--straight` when classes are on the same row to avoid bends.
- **Dependency:** Dashed line for creates/uses relationships (e.g., Rollable creates Check). Use `dependency-orthogonal` (right-angle routing) when any class sits between source and target — straight dashed lines cut through intervening classes. Default to orthogonal; use straight only when source and target are adjacent with nothing between them.
- **Grid layout:** Position classes in rows — parents row 0, children/dependents row 1+. Avoid all-on-one-row; aim for a square diagram.
- **No overlaps:** After positioning, run `inspect` to check for overlapping classes. Use `move` to fix.
- **No crossing edges:** Position classes so edges don't cross over other classes. Place related classes adjacent. After adding edges, visually trace each one — if it would pass through another class's bounding box, either reposition the source/target class or switch to orthogonal routing.

## UML Relationship Selection

| Relationship | When to use | DrawIO style |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Inheritance** | Concept extends another (e.g., Ability : Rollable) | Hollow triangle; `inheritance-orthogonal` when child is offset from parent column |
| **Composition** | Part cannot exist without whole; collection property (e.g., Character ◆→ Ability via Dictionary) | Filled diamond |
| **Aggregation** | Whole references part but part has independent lifecycle (e.g., Character ◇→ PowerLevel) | Hollow diamond |
| **Association** | Concept uses another in operations (e.g., Check → DC, Check → Degree) | Open arrow |
| **Dependency** | Concept creates instances of another (e.g., Rollable --creates-→ Check) | Dashed arrow (orthogonal routing default) |

## Cross-Model Imports

When a concept from one foundational model is referenced in another (e.g., Ability extends Rollable from Resolution System), mark it explicitly in both places.

### Domain Model Convention

Add `[from: Source Module]` after the base class:

```
**Ability** : Rollable [from: Resolution System]
**AttackCheck** : Check [from: Resolution System]
```

### Class Diagram Convention

Add the imported class using `--imported-from`:

```bash
python drawio_class_cli.py add-class <file> --page "Character Trait System" --name Rollable --imported-from "Resolution System" --props "Number modifier" --x 40 --y 620
```

The imported class renders with a dashed border and a `«from: Module»` stereotype label above the name. Add inheritance edges from local classes to the import as normal.

### Keeping Cross-Model References in Sync

When a concept changes in its home model:
1. Update the concept in the home model's page and domain-model.md section
2. Update imported copies in other pages (properties may differ — imports typically show only the key properties)
3. Run `inspect` on pages that import the concept to verify edges still connect

**Imported classes are lightweight copies** — they show the concept name, stereotype, and key properties only. They don't need full operations or invariants (those live in the home model).

## Domain Model Type Conventions

- **Enum types** for constrained options: `EnumType name {value1, value2, ...}` — not `String name (option1/option2)`
- **Derived properties** with invariants: `Number cost` + `Invariant: cost = rank × 2` — not `calculate_cost() → Number`
- **Invariants** for all rules, formulas, and constraints — not embedded in property descriptions or operation signatures

## Class Diagram Rules

Rules tagged `class_diagram` in `rules/` govern diagram rendering conventions. These are injected when using the class diagram CLI tool — they are NOT part of synthesis run instructions. Apply them during the rendering workflow below.

Key rules:
- **Hierarchy flow** — base classes top, children below (`domain-ooa-diagram-hierarchy-flow.md`)
- **Cross-model imports** — import base classes that establish ancestry context (`domain-ooa-diagram-cross-model-imports.md`)
- **Edge routing** — explicit exit/entry points when multiple edges share a source (`domain-ooa-diagram-edge-routing.md`)

## AI Workflow for Rendering

**Incremental first.** If the `.drawio` file already exists, use `update-class`, `add-class`, `delete-class`, and edge commands to apply only what changed — do not regenerate the whole file. Full regeneration destroys manual layout adjustments. Use the full workflow below only when creating a diagram for the first time.

After producing domain model output for a slice:

1. **Review `class_diagram` rules** — apply positioning and edge conventions from `rules/domain-ooa-diagram-*.md`
2. **Init** page if needed: `init <file> --page "<Model Name>"`
3. **Add classes** with rows and invariants at planned grid positions (base classes top, children below). **Always include collaborator types** — every row must show its collaborators using `name : Collaborator` notation (e.g., `character : Character`, `resist : Character, Trait, Graded Check Result`). The source determines where the collaborators come from:
   - **CRC source** — the collaborator column after the pipe (`|`) becomes the type annotation on the row.
   - **Ubiquitous Language source** — each verb-led behavior bullet becomes one row. Row label = the bullet text with italic markers stripped; collaborators = the `*italicized*` terms in that bullet. `**Invariant:**` bullets render in the third compartment. `### Subtype *is a type of* Base` headings drive inheritance edges. `### term *(boundary)*` scoped stubs render as imported cards with `«boundary: OwningModule»` stereotype. See `rules/class-diagram-ubiquitous-language-bullets-become-rows.md`.
   - **Object model source** — typed signatures (`+ name: Type`) become the row format.
   - Primitives in any source use parenthetical notation: `status : (success or failure)`.
4. **Add edges** — inheritance first (defines vertical structure), then composition/aggregation, then associations/dependencies. Use explicit exitX/exitY/entryX/entryY when multiple edges leave the same class. For ULL sources, **fold duplicate cross-concept references**: if three bullets on the same concept reference the same italicized target, emit one association edge, not three.
5. **Audit** — run `audit_diagram_report(path)` (from `drawio_tools.py`) and read all violations. Priority: (1) `class_overlap` = zero, (2) `edge_crosses_class` = zero, (3) minimize `edge_on_edge_overlap`, (4) minimize `shared_anchor`.
6. **Iterate** — fix violations by repositioning classes (`move`), switching edge styles (e.g., `inheritance` → `inheritance-orthogonal`), or adding explicit `exit_x/exit_y/entry_x/entry_y` anchors. Rerun audit after each fix.
7. **Verify** sync: `sync-to-model` should report "no changes" (diagram matches model). For ULL sources, sync covers added/deleted concepts and inheritance headings only — bullet-level edits do not round-trip; edit the markdown directly.

## Persisting Module Build Scripts

When a full render produces a bespoke Python script that builds the diagram (all classes, edges, anchors, waypoints in one atomic pass), **keep the script** in the destination repo at `<repo-root>/scripts/build_<name>_diagram.py`. Do not delete it after the render succeeds.

| Property | Why it matters |
|----------|---------------|
| **Re-runnable** | Model evolves; re-run the script to regenerate without replaying layout reasoning |
| **Extendable** | New KA page, class, or edge is a small edit, not a from-scratch session |
| **Auditable** | Readable record of every layout decision (positions, widths, anchors, waypoints) |

Each script should:

1. Import `drawio_tools` from the skill's `scripts/` directory.
2. Build atomically — create mxfile, add all pages/classes/edges, save once.
3. Run `audit_diagram_report()` at the end and print the result.
4. Be runnable standalone: `python scripts/build_<name>_diagram.py`.
5. Exit non-zero when audit fails.

When the model changes incrementally, **edit the existing build script** rather than writing a new one.

## When User Edits the Diagram in DrawIO

1. User saves the diagram
2. Run `sync-to-model` to see diffs and apply changes back to `domain-model.md`
