```

**Usage:** See [skills/content-memory/SKILL.md](skills/content-memory/SKILL.md) for full instructions.

### solution-shaping

Shape source material into an Interaction Tree and State Model (story map and domain model). Use when shaping requirements, deriving epics and stories from source documents, or building a hierarchical structure of actor exchanges and domain concepts.

**Install:**

npx skills add agilebydesign/agilebydesign-skills --skill solution-shaping
```

**Usage:** See [skills/solution-shaping/SKILL.md](skills/solution-shaping/SKILL.md) for full instructions.

## Development (repository contributors)

Shared Python modules live under `src/` and are copied into skills (for example DrawIO helpers into **abd-story-synthesizer**). After editing `src/`, regenerate and verify:

```bash
python scripts/sync_drawio_vendor.py
python scripts/sync_drawio_vendor.py --check
```
