"""
Set or get the active skill workspace for abd-ooad.

Usage:
  python set_workspace.py              -- prints active_skill_workspace from skill-config.json
  python set_workspace.py <path>       -- sets active_skill_workspace to <path> in skill-config.json

The skill-config.json file is stored at the skill package root (same directory as SKILL.md).
Paths are resolved and stored relative to skill_path when possible (to keep them portable),
otherwise as absolute paths.
