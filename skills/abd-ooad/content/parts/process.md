## Standards and Tools

- **Diagrams:** See `using-diagram-cli` library shard — `scripts/drawio_cli.py` workflow, `templates/` directory, and all layout rules.
- **Workspace routing:** See [`../library/workspace-and-config.md`](library/workspace-and-config.md) for `skill_path`, `skill_workspace`, and portable path resolution.

---

## Build and Generate

- **Build all phases into AGENTS.md:** `python scripts/base/build.py`
- **Generate a single phase:** `python scripts/base/generate.py --phase <slug>`
- **List available phases:** See **`skill-config.json`** → **`phase_files`**

## Implementation Notes

**Strategy before deep runs:** After domain scan, fill **`strategy.md`** (**modeling scope** + **execution plan**) so you know **which phases**, **in what order**, and **on what slice** of the source (e.g. one chapter at a time). Align **`abd-ooad/progress/strategy-run-checklist.md`** with that plan; then run **`generate.py --phase <slug>`** for the active phase. See **`library/strategy-execution-and-checklists.md`**.

**AI-driven phases:** Each phase can be executed by Claude following the assembled instructions from **`generate.py`** or **`AGENTS.md`**.

**Code-driven phases:** Workspace config (Phase 0) is CLI-driven; all OOAD phases (1–21) are AI-driven narrative/modeling.

**Static vs dynamic delivery:**
- **Dynamic (default):** `generate.py` assembles phase on each call
- **Static:** `build.py` pre-assembles to `content/built/phases/`; `generate.py --mode static` reads cached version
