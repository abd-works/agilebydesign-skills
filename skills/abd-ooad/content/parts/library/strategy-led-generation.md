# Strategy-led generation

Domain scan (OOAD **phase 1**) does not only produce a single “results” file. It establishes a **small set of workspace files** under `<workspace>/abd-ooad/` that work together. Some are **frozen findings** from the scan; others are **living documents** you update as modeling continues.

For the scan procedure itself, see the **Domain scan** phase. This page explains **what each artifact is for** and how **`strategy.md`** relates to **`domain-scan-results.md`**.

**Checkbox discipline:** Live ticks for pipeline position and phase steps belong only under **`<workspace>/abd-ooad/progress/`** — see **`library/base/checklist.md`** and **`library/strategy-execution-and-checklists.md`**. Do not put tick tables in `strategy.md`.

## The five scan outputs (always)

Created during domain scan under `<workspace>/abd-ooad/`:

| File | Role | Updates after scan? |
|------|------|---------------------|
| `domain-scan-results.md` | **Findings snapshot:** source map, anchor table, tensions. | Rarely — only if you correct a scan error. Do not put the forward plan here; that belongs in `strategy.md`. |
| `strategy.md` | **Living strategy:** **modeling scope**, **execution plan (normative)** — which phases in what order and on what slice of context — plus **approach** and **dated pivots**. | **Yes** — whenever scope, order, or focus changes. |
| `domain-scan-model.md` | Class sketch (markdown) at scan fidelity. | Yes, in later phases — not only during scan. |
| `domain-scan-model.drawio` | Diagram at scan fidelity. | Same as model.md. |
| `term-registry.md` | Terms, **Classification** (model role), **Status** (OOAD scale), confidence — seeded at scan. | **Yes** — every later phase updates Step, Classification, and Status as the model evolves. |

**Plus** (when workspace is configured): **`progress/`** checklists — see **`library/strategy-execution-and-checklists.md`**. **`generate.py`** creates **`process-checklist.md`**, **`<phase>-checklist.md`**, and (abd-ooad) **`strategy-run-checklist.md`** when templates exist and files are missing. Normative phase steps stay in **`content/parts/phases/<phase>.md`**. These are the **only** place for session tick marks.

Walkthrough diagrams (`.md` / `.drawio`) are **not** required at scan fidelity; they start when the skill’s later phases call for them.

## What `strategy.md` is for

- Created at the end of domain scan as a **workspace file**, then **kept current** through extraction and later phases.
- **Purpose:** (1) **scope** — what chapters, anchors, or files you model; (2) **execution plan** — ordered list of phase slugs with **per-step scope** (e.g. run nouns-verbs on Chapter 5, then the next three phases on Chapter 6); (3) short **why** in *Approach going forward* and **pivots** in *Ongoing strategic decisions*. Scan mechanics live in **`domain-scan-results.md`**.
- **Template:** `templates/strategy.md`. Install as **`strategy.md`** (lowercase; avoid duplicate `STRATEGY.md` on case-insensitive disks).
- After you finalize the execution plan, align **`progress/strategy-run-checklist.md`** with it (same phases and scope); that file holds **checkboxes** for “which phase is done,” while **`strategy.md`** stays **normative text** (no `- [ ]`).

## Checklist vs results vs strategy

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where is the source map and anchor list? | `domain-scan-results.md` |
| Where do I define “we model Chapter 5 first, then Chapter 6” and **which phases** per slice? | `strategy.md` → **Modeling scope** + **Execution plan (normative)** |
| Where do I tick **which phases** we ran, **in order**, with **scope**? | **`abd-ooad/progress/strategy-run-checklist.md`** (keep in sync with `strategy.md`) |
| Where do I tick **full** pipeline position (all phases)? | **`abd-ooad/progress/process-checklist.md`** (optional reference) |
| Where do I tick **steps inside** the current phase? | **`abd-ooad/progress/<phase>-checklist.md`** |
| Where do I tick domain-scan action steps? | **`abd-ooad/progress/domain-scan-checklist.md`** |
| Can I merge checklist into strategy? | **No** — strategy holds the plan; ticks only under **`progress/`** |

---

## Going forward (phases after scan)

1. **Strategy** — Keep **`strategy.md`** aligned with reality; append *Ongoing strategic decisions* when you pivot.
2. **Strategy execution** — Tick **`progress/strategy-run-checklist.md`** as you **complete** each phase for its declared scope.
3. **Phase work** — For the active phase, run **`generate.py --phase <slug>`** and tick **`progress/<slug>-checklist.md`** for action steps.
4. **Registry** — Keep `term-registry.md` aligned with the current phase (Step, Classification, Status).
5. **Results** — Touch `domain-scan-results.md` only for corrections to the original scan snapshot.
