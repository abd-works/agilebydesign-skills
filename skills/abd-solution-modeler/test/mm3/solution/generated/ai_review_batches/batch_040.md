RANGE

Each  effect  has  a  default  range,  which  may  be  changed
by modifiers.

•

•

•

•

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

DURATION

so.  If  you  are  incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  ac-
tion, or simply choose not to, the effect ends.

Sustained: You can keep a sustained effect going by
taking  a  free  action  each  round  to  do  so.  If  you  are
incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  action,  or  simply
choose not to, the effect ends.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

SNARE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Extra  Condition,
Resisted by Dodge, Limited Degree • 3 points per rank

You can restrain a target with bonds of ice, glue, web-
bing, bands of energy, and so forth (whatever suits your
descriptors). The target makes a Dodge resistance check
against your effect DC. One degree of failure leaves the
target hindered and vulnerable, while two results in the
target becoming defenseless and immobilized. There is
no additional effect for three or more degrees of failure.

The resistance check to break out of a Snare is based on
Damage (including Strength Damage) or Sleight of Hand,
either breaking the effect or slipping out of it. This is part of
the power’s Alternate Resistance, with no change in cost.

Mental Link: You  have  a  mental  link  with  your  minions,
allowing you to communicate with them and issue orders
telepathically like the Communication Link effect (see the
Senses effects in this chapter). Flat +1 point.

Multiple  Minions:  You  can  summon  more  than  one
minion. Each application of this extra doubles your total
number of minions. So, for example, with Summon 6, you
summon a single 90-point minion. With Multiple Minions
1, you can summon two 90-point minions, with Multiple
Minions  2,  four  minions,  and  so  forth.  It  requires  a  stan-
dard action to summon each minion unless you also have
the Horde extra (see previous). +2 cost per rank.

STRIKE

Effect: Damage • 1 point per rank

You  inflict  additional  damage  in  close  combat.  Your
Strike  either  substitutes  for  your  Strength  damage  or
adds  to  it,  if  it  is  Strength-based,  see  the  Damage  ef-
fect for details. It might be claws, energy fields, focused
striking  strength,  or  something  similar,  depending  on
your  descriptors.  Close  combat  weapons  are  either
equipment or this power with the Removable flaw. See
the Gadgets & Gear chapter (following) for more infor-
mation.

Sacrifice: When you are hit with an effect requiring a resis-
tance check, you can spend a hero point to shift it to one
of your minions instead. The minion must be within range
of the effect and a viable target. Needless to say, this is not
a particularly heroic ability. In fact, the GM may wish to re-
strict  it  to  villains  or  non-player  characters  (in  which  case
a hero earns a hero point when a villain uses this extra to
avoid an effect by sacrificing a minion). Flat +1 point.

DAMAGE

ATTACK

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Instant • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can inflict damage on a target by making a close at-
tack. The exact nature of your Damage is up to you, with
the GM’s approval; it can be anything from a powerful im-
pact to razor claws, energy fields, or some other damaging
medium. The target resists with Toughness:

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage, the target’s condition shifts to dying. A dying tar-
get who fails a resistance check against Damage is dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability
to hit things! You can apply effect modifiers to the Dam-
age your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even
an  Area  effect!  You  can  also  have  Alternate  Effects  for
your Strength Damage; see the Alternate Effect modi-
fier  for  details.  Like  other  Damage  effects,  a  character’s
Strength Damage is close range and instant duration by
default.

If  you  choose,  a  Damage  effect  can  be  Strength-
based—something like a melee weapon—allowing your
Strength Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and
Damage  ranks  together  when  determining  the  rank  of
the attack. Any modifiers applied to your Damage must
also apply to your Strength rank if its bonus damage is
to  benefit  from  them.  However,  any  decrease  in  your
Strength reduces the amount you can add to your Dam-
age, and negative Strength subtracts from your Damage!
Likewise, anything that prevents you from exerting your

be “recovered” in some fashion, such as recharging, rest,
repair, reloading, and so forth. The GM decides when and
how a faded effect recovers, but it should generally occur
outside of combat and take at least an hour’s time. The GM
may  allow  a  hero  to  recover  a  faded  effect  immediately
and completely by spending a hero point.

usable only in certain situations and those usable only on
certain  things.  For  example  Only  While  Singing  Loudly,
Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against
Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth. As a gen-
eral rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to
qualify  for  this  modifier.  Anything  less  limiting  is  better
handled as an occasional complication.

FEEDBACK

-1 COST PER RANK

You suffer damage when a manifestation of your effect is
damaged. This  flaw  only  applies  to  effects  with  physical
(or  apparently  physical)  manifestations,  such  as  Create,
Illusion,  or  Summon,  for  example.  If  your  power’s  mani-
festation  is  damaged,  make  a  resistance  check  against
the attack’s damage rank, using your effect’s rank as the
resistance check bonus. For example, if a manifestation of
a rank 10 effect is attacked for damage 12, you must make
a resistance check against damage 12 with a +10 bonus
(the effect’s rank) in place of your normal Toughness.

GRAB-BASED

-1 COST PER RANK

An attack effect with this flaw requires you to successfully
grab a target before using the effect (see Grab, page 248).
This generally applies to an effect that is close range, since
you have to be in close combat to grab anyway. If the ef-
fect’s default range is not close, apply the Close modifier
as well. If you do not succeed on the grab, you cannot use
the effect. If your grab attempt succeeds, the effect occurs
automatically as a reaction.

Example: Lamprey has a draining touch that is a
Grab-Based  Weaken  Strength  effect.  So  the  mon-
strous  villain  has  to  take  a  standard  action  and
make a grab first in order to use it. If his close attack
check hits, the target makes a Dodge or Fortitude
resistance  check  against  Lamprey’s  Strength.  If  it
fails, the target then makes the Fortitude resistance
check against the villain’s Weaken effect to see how
much Strength Lamprey drains away.

This  flaw  is  essentially  a  form  of  Resistible,  with  a  grab
check rather than a regular resistance check (see the Re-
sistible flaw for more).

Effect: Variable (assumed forms), Move Action • 8 points
per rank

You  can  transform  into  different  forms,  gaining  the
physical  traits  (abilities,  skills,  advantages,  and  pow-
ers) of the assumed form. You gain (Shapeshift rank x 5)
power points worth of traits. You can also redistribute
points spent on your own physical traits (lowering your
Strength to apply those points elsewhere, for example).
You are limited to the inherent traits of the forms you
assume and do not gain new mental traits, even if that
form possesses them.

Shapeshift is often further Limited by the specific types
of forms the character can assume, such as Limited to
Animals or Limited to Machines.

ter’s perceptions are unreliable, the sense appears to work,
but the character gets the wrong information. For this rea-
son, the GM should make all reliability checks for Senses
in secret, just informing the player of what the character
does (or does not) notice. –1 cost per rank.

SHRINKING

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily decrease your size, becoming smaller,
harder to see — and hit — at the cost of losing Strength
and  speed.  Every  4  ranks  of  Shrinking  reduces  your  size
rank by 1 (normal humans are size rank –2 by default) and
each reduction in size rank subtracts 1 from your Strength
and every two reductions in size rank subtract 1 from your
ground speed rank. Add half your Shrinking rank (rounded
down)  to  your  active  defenses.  Add  your  Shrinking  rank
as a bonus to Stealth checks, since you are harder to spot,
but apply half your rank (rounded down) as a penalty to In-
timidation checks (hard to be imposing when you’re tiny).
Shrinking modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

So  at  Shrinking  12,  you  are  size  rank  –5  (about  6  inches
tall),  and  have  a  +6  bonus  to  active  defenses  and  +12
Stealth bonus, but –3 Strength, –1 speed, and –6 Intimida-
tion penalties.
EXTRAS

Atomic: At Shrinking 20 (and size rank –7), you can shrink
down to the molecular or even atomic level, allowing you
to pass through solid objects by slipping between their at-
oms. It takes at least a full turn to do so, possibly longer for
larger objects. You’re effectively immune to damage and
many effects at this scale, since you are essentially shifted
out of the ordinary universe. The GM decides if a particular
effect can reach you at the atomic level. If you have

Triplets, then add the points for the Summon power.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

CREATE

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while Sum-
mon  conjures  creatures  of  some  sort,  capable  of  inde-
pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless
creatures  like  ro

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

243

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

RANGE

Each  effect  has  a  default  range,  which  may  be  changed
by modifiers.

•

•

•

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

tion, or simply choose not to, the effect ends.

Sustained: You can keep a sustained effect going by
taking  a  free  action  each  round  to  do  so.  If  you  are
incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  action,  or  simply
choose not to, the effect ends.

Identity:  Some  Powerhouses  keep  their  identity  a
secret  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Especially  those
Powerhouses  that  can  change  into  and  out  of  their
super-powered identity.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Those  Powerhouses  with
the  Prejudice  complication  often  choose  this  mo-
tivation  and  become  a  hero  in  order  to  earn  a  place
in  “normal”  society.  An  alien  Powerhouse  may  also
choose this motivation even if he or she doesn’t look
unusual.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  Many  Powerhouses  are
die-hard  patriots  and  fight  to  defend  or  represent
their country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: Due to their incredible
powers, many Powerhouses become heroes because
they feel as if they have a responsibility to do so.

Power  Loss:  Some  Powerhouses  lose  their  powers

even being treated like a monster!

group of friends he or she relies on for human con-
tact and friendship. These relationships are very im-

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

As you can see, once you break it down, checks are actual-
ly fairly simple. All the Gamemaster has to say in response
to the player’s declaration is: “Okay, roll a Fighting check
to hit the villain,” letting the rest of the description stand
as what happens. Whether or not the hero is successful in
stopping the trap depends on the outcome of the attack
against the bad guy.

Of course, if the villain is expecting the hero, there might be
another trap, such as part of the catwalk rigged to fall away
under him, leaving him dangling above the acid vat and at
the villain’s mercy! In that case, the GM would respond to
the  player’s  description: “You  smash  through  the  skylight
and swing over to the catwalk, but when you do...” and go
on to describe what follows. The rest of the hero’s intended
action(s) are null and void, because things don’t always go
as planned when you’re dealing with cunning supervillains!

Checks are used to resolve all outcomes in MUTANTS & MAS-
TERMINDS,  so  once  you  understand  the  basic  concept,  the
rest is easy. For detailed examples of how to use checks in
the game and their effects, see the Action & Adventure
chapter.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored a critical success. Determine the degree of success
normally and then increase it by one degree. This can turn
a low-level success into something more significant, but
more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-fledged
success! A critical success with an attack check is called a
critical hit, discussed later in this chapter and in the Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter.

Checks are made against a difficulty class or DC, a num-
ber set by the GM, which your check must equal or exceed
to achieve success. So for a task with a DC of 15 you must
roll a check total of 15 or greater to succeed. In some cas-
es, the results of a check vary based on how much higher
or lower the result is than the DC, known as its degree of
success or failure.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Lady  Liberty,  rescuing  people  from  a
tenement  fire,  is  hemmed-in  by  collapsed  debris.
Her player decides to simply punch a path through.
Since  she’s  going  for  maximum  damage,  she  de-
cides  to  make  the  attack  check  normally  (rather
than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she’ll
only miss on a natural 1 anyway. She succeeds and
does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic
critical. The GM decides the brick, mortar, and heavy
beams have a toughness of 9 and makes a Tough-
ness  check,  rolling  a  5,  against  a  DC  30  (Lady  Lib-
erty’s Damage +15). A 14 result is three degrees of
failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and
clears the building, carrying people to safety!

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

Living targets remove one damage condition per minute
of  rest,  starting  from  their  worst  condition  and  working
back. So a damaged character recovers from being inca-
pacitated, then staggered, dazed, and finally removes a –1
Toughness check penalty per minute until fully recovered.
The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications  (see  Lasting Injuries  in  the  Recovery section
of the Action & Adventure chapter).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

One player—the Gamemaster or “GM”—takes responsibility for running a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game. The Game-
master  creates  the  adventure,  runs  the  players  through  it,  takes  on  the  roles  of  the  various  other  characters  the
heroes encounter, and handles any questions about the rules as they arise. The Gamemaster also adjudicates the
process of character creation, deciding what traits, modifiers, and so forth are appropriate for the particular game,
along with the best way to express certain concepts in game terms. While Gamemastering is a big responsibility, it’s
not as hard as it might seem, and providing a fun and entertaining game for your friends can be quite rewarding.

While the players are responsible for keeping track of their characters and deciding on their actions, the Gamemaster is
responsible for everything else that happens in the game. A good GM tries to make sure the game runs as smoothly as
possible and is enjoyable for all of the players. Many components go into creating a good MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game.
The following sections give you the basics, but experience is the best tool to help you become a better Gamemaster.

can  be  broken  down  into  a  series
of tasks the heroes must perform, from piecing together
clues  about  a  villain’s  latest  scheme  to  blasting  said  vil-
lain through a wall and disarming his doomsday device in
the nick of time. It’s up to the Gamemaster to assign the
difficulty of these and numerous other tasks in the game
and to determine the outcome of the heroes’ efforts. This
section  offers  some  general  guidelines  on  assigning  the
difficulty of a task.

THE 55% RULE

tract 10 from the DC. So a DC 25 action (a formidable task)
requires a bonus of +15 in order to have a 55% chance of
success (on a roll of 10 or higher).

Keep in mind that this chance of success on a task allows
a character to automatically succeed at that task as a rou-
tine  check  (see  Routine  Checks,  following,  and  in  The
Basics chapter). This is intentional; the average character
only really fails at an average task when hurried or under
stress. A 55% chance also allows a player to spend a hero
point to automatically succeed, since a hero point ensures
a die roll of at least 11. (See Hero Points, page 20.)

A good guideline to keep in mind is the chance of an aver-
age character (with a modifier of 0) succeeding

goes off. For every two full degrees of success, the explo-
sive deals +5 damage to the structure. Failure means the
explosive does not go off as planned, while more than one
degree of failure means the charge goes off while you are
setting it! In all cases, the explosive deals normal damage
to all other targets.

You  can  make  an  explosive  device  more  difficult  to  dis-
arm. To do so, choose a disarm difficulty class before mak-
ing  your  check  to  set  the  detonator. Your  DC  to  set  the
detonator  is  the  desired  disarm  DC.  Failure  means  the
explosive fails to go off as planned. Two or more degrees
of failure mean the explosive goes off as the detonator is
being installed!

Disarming an explosive also requires a Technology check.
The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the deto-
nator chose a higher disarm DC (previously). If you fail the
check, you do not disarm the explosive. With more than a
degree of failure, the explosive goes off. Setting or disarm-
ing a detonator is a standard action.
INVENTING

If you have the Inventor advantage (see the Advantages
chapter),  you  can  use  Technology  to  create  inventions,
temporary devices. See Inventing, page 211, for details.

SECURITY

You  can  use  Technology  to  disarm  or  sabotage  various
security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This
takes  at  least  a  minute,  possibly  longer,  at  the  GM’s  dis-
cretion.  The  GM  makes  your  Technology  check  secretly
so you don’t necessarily know right away if you have suc-
ceeded. The Gamemaster sets the DC of the check based
on the level of security:

Simple lock or home alarm system

Quality lock or home alarm system

Business and corporate security

High security: branch bank vault, museum

Very high security: bank headquarters
vault, medium prison

Maximum security: highly secure prison

Super-max security: super-prison

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

hand” for talking about a group of basic conditions that
go together in a particular circumstance, much like a pow-
er is a collection of basic effects.

The individual conditions making up a combined condi-
tion can be resolved individually. For example, if an effect
that removes the dazed condition is used on a staggered
character (who is dazed and hindered), then the character
is no longer dazed, only hindered. Similarly, if an effect im-
poses a condition that supersedes part of the combined
condition, only that part changes. So an effect that stuns a
staggered character means the character is now stunned
(superseding  dazed)  and  hindered.  Similarly,  an  effect
that immobilizes a staggered character leaves the target
dazed and immobile (superseding the hindered element
of the combined condition).

with  three  or  more  degrees  of  success  wakes  the
character and removes all these conditions, as does
any sudden movement (such as shaking the sleeping
character) or any effect allowing a resistance check.

Blind:  The  character  cannot  see.  Everything  ef-
fectively  has  full  visual  concealment  from  him.  He
is  hindered,  visually  unaware,  and  vulnerable,  and
may be impaired or disabled for activities where vi-
sion is a factor.

Bound: A bound character is defenseless, immobile,
and impaired.

Deaf: The  character  cannot  hear,  giving  everything
total  auditory  concealment  from  him.  This  may  al-
low  for  surprise  attacks  on  the  unaware  character
(see  Surprise  Attack  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). Interaction with other characters is limited
to  sign-language  and  lip-reading  (see  Interaction
Skills in Chapter 3).

Dying: A dying character is incapacitated (defense-
less, stunned, and unaware) and near death. When
the  character  gains  this  condition,  immediately
make  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  15).  If  the  check  suc-
ceeds,  nothing  happens. With  two  degrees  of  suc-
cess,  the  character  stabilizes,  removing  this  condi-
tion. If the check fails, the character remains dying.
Three  or  more  total  degrees  of  failure  mean  the
character  dies:  so  three  failed  Fortitude  checks  or
one or two checks adding up to three degrees. Dy-
ing  characters  make  a  Fortitude  check  each  round

HOOD: SUPER-SHIELDS

Just as power armor is a device version of otherwise or-
dinary equipment armor, some heroes (and, less often,
villains) have shield devices providing them with great-
er benefits than an ordinary shield.

A shield device may provide Enhanced Dodge and Parry
defenses  like  a  mundane  shield,  or  it  can  grant  ranks
of  Protection  (which  do  stack  with  other  effects,  since
they’re not from equipment), perhaps even Impervious
Protection  for  a “bulletproof”  or “indestructible”  shield.
Such benefits are typically Sustained in duration, requir-
ing some action on the shield-wielder’s part.

A super-shield might even be useful as a weapon, pro-
viding a Damage effect, probably Strength-based. This is
best handled as an Alternate Effect of the shield, mean-
ing you can’t use it both offensively and defensively at
the same time! A hero able to hurl a shield at foes can
even have a Ranged Damage effect with it.

Chain-mail: A shirt of heavy metal chain, often with a coif
(hood) to cover the wearer’s head.

Plate-mail:  This  is  chain-mail  augmented  with  a  metal
breastplate, greaves (leg-guards) and arm-guards.

Undercover shirt: A thin shirt of ballistic armor that can
be worn under street clothes.

Small shield: A small hand shield large enough to cover
the wearer’s forearm.

arm, able to shield a large portion of the torso.

ample,  Enhanced  Strength  5  increases  your  Strength  by
+5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to
power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be be-
low the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement
to accommodate it.

You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your
reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to de-
termine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized hu-
man (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2,
and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles!
“Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action.

The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquir-
ing a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that
Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait,
and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and
other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and
Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a great-
er  distance  by  elongating  your  limbs.  Once  elongated,
you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a
standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target
(you’re  elongating  around  a  corner,  for  example),  apply
the  rules  for  concealment  (see  Concealment  in  the  Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows
you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a
+1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

into  play—like  losing  your  Enhanced  Trait  during  a  new
moon—can be handled as a power loss complication. See
Complications in The Basics chapter for details. –1 cost per

RANGE

Each  effect  has  a  default  range,  which  may  be  changed
by modifiers.

•

•

•

•

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

DURATION

so.  If  you  are  incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  ac-
tion, or simply choose not to, the effect ends.

Sustained: You can keep a sustained effect going by
taking  a  free  action  each  round  to  do  so.  If  you  are
incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  action,  or  simply
choose not to, the effect ends.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

TRANSFORM

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2-5 points per rank

You can change objects into other objects, altering their
shape  or  material  composition  in  the  process. You  must
touch  the  chosen  object,  which  requires  a  close  attack
check if the object is held or worn by another character.

What you can transform affects cost per rank:

•

2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one
other thing or substance, such as metal into wood,
iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.

Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands
of a cunning player. To a degree, Transform can dupli-
cate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by
transforming air into a solid material or turning oxygen
into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). This is perfectly
allowable; use the rules for other effects as guidelines
on how to handle these situations, using Transform rank
to determine resistance DCs.

Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained
duration, which may affect how such “tricks” work (e.g.,
the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffo-
cating gas dissipates unless the character concentrates
each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always,
the GM should use common sense and good judgment.

You  may  wish  to  require  characters  using  Transform
to  acquire  money  (gold,  precious  gems,  etc.)  or  other
permanent  material  goods  to  spend  power  points  on
ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain imperma-
nent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter
in your series in some way.)

It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects:
turning a steel door into water, air, or even rust certain-
ly  removes  it  as  a  barrier.  However,  keep  in  mind  that
Transform  is  normally  sustained;  the  target  isn’t  truly
destroyed unless the effect is continuous, and therefore
irreversible. Even then, the destruction of targets tends
to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of wearing-
down  and  eventually  destroying  objects,  use  Weaken
Toughness instead.

Transforming living or otherwise animate beings as op-
posed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than
Transform. To alter a target’s outward appearance only,
go  with  a  Morph  Attack  (see  the  Morph  effect).  For  a
harmful effect that does something like turn the target

Action: Free • Range: Personal

You have a special form of movement. For each rank in this
effect, choose one of the following options:

You  can  move  instantly  from  one  dimension  to  another
as a move action. For 1 rank, you can move between your
home dimension and one other. For 2 ranks you can move
between  any  of  a  related  group  of  dimensions  (mystical
dimensions,  alien  dimensions,  etc).  For  3  ranks  you  can
travel to any dimension. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass
rank 0) of additional material with you when you move. If
you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry ad-
ditional mass up to your modifier rank.

You’re  adapted  to  a  particular  environment,  such  as  un-
derwater,  zero  gravity,  and  so  forth  (see  Environmental
Hazards,  pages  185-187,  for  details). You  suffer  none  of
the normal unfavorable circumstance or movement pen-
alties associated with that environment, moving and act-

ards like suffocation, exposure, and so forth. You need the
Immunity effect to ignore such things.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Perception range effects must accurately perceive a target in order to affect it. This generally means you cannot target
subjects with total concealment from your accurate senses with perception range effects. Thus, foes with Visual Conceal-
ment (the most common accurate sense) can be quite effective against characters relying on perception range attacks,
unless the attacker has an unusual accurate sense to circumvent the Concealment. This is one reason Visual Concealment
costs extra.

At the Gamemaster’s discretion, a successful Perception check to accurately locate a target with an acute sense may al-
low you to use perception range effects on that target; however, the target still benefits from concealment, granting a +5
circumstance bonus to resistance against the effect.

ranks. A plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it
won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions
or answer questions about events outside its immediate
vicinity.

SPIRITS

You can communicate with incorporeal and normally in-
visible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or cer-
tain extradimensional entities, depending on the context
of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as
a “medium” of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what
you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly under-
stood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM’s
discretion,  this  effect  may  extend  to  undead  creatures,
demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the
setting.

FLAWS

Type: You can only comprehend a broad type of subject
(only elves, canines, avians, or sea creatures, for example).
For an additional flaw, you can only comprehend a narrow
type of subject (dogs, falcons, or dolphins, for example).
Broad –1 cost per rank. Narrow –2 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You gain total concealment from a particular sense while
this  effect  is  active,  although  you  are  still  detectable  to
other senses (even other senses of the same sense type;
so you could have full concealment against normal sight,
but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense
type).  Each  additional  rank  gives  you  concealment  from
another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an en-
tire sense type. See Concealment on page 244 for the full
effects.

Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for
one

the  round  in  which  the  duration  ends.  So,  for  example,
an instant duration Affliction only lasts one round, while
a  sustained  duration  Affliction  lasts  until  no  longer  sus-
tained. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Degree: Your Affliction is limited to no more than
two degrees of effect. With two applications of this modi-
fier, it is limited to no more than one degree of effect. –1
cost per rank.

BURROWING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel be-
hind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a
speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Bur-
rowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground
at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard
clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank.
Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional
ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or
collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you
begin burrowing each new tunnel).

Note  that  Burrowing  differs  from  the  Permeate  effect  of
Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle
like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing
it at all (see Movement for details).
EXTRAS

Penetrating:  Normally,  the  hardness  of  the  ground  af-
fects  only  the  speed  at  which  you  burrow.  At  the  GM’s
discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered
Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows
you to dig through them. 1 point per rank.

Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a
greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of
the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Oth-
ers, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone
else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of
the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Limited:  Burrowing  may  be  limited  to  certain  circum-
stances  or  materials,  such  as  only  loose  sand  and  soil

BLAST

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You  can  make  a  damaging  ranged  attack.  It  might  be
a  blast  of  energy,  a  projectile  (arrow,  bullet,  throwing
blade, etc.), or some similar effect. You make a ranged
attack  check  against  the  target’s  Dodge  defense.  The
attack’s damage equals your power rank and the target
makes a Toughness resistance check against it.

Armor: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addi-
tion to its normal Toughness, possibly including Imper-
vious  Protection.  Some  vehicles  may  have  Sustained
Protection (such as force screens) instead of, or in addi-
tion to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.

Cloaking Device: A vehicle may have a “cloaking de-
vice” granting Concealment from visual senses. Some
vehicles  may  also  have  Concealment  from  auditory
senses or things such as radar, giving them a “stealth
mode.” 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense
type) or 8 points (all visual senses).

Immunity:  Vehicles  normally  provide
immunity
to  the  normal  hazards  of  environments  they  travel
through—such  as  underwater  or  in  space—at  no
additional  cost.  Additional  Immunity  effects  are  for
unusual hazards or circumstances, such as a car that
provides  a  sealed  air  system,  granting  immunity  to
suffocation and other atmospheric hazards.

Smokescreen:  The  vehicle  can  release  a  cloud  of
thick smoke or mist that provides an Area visual Con-
cealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pur-
suers. 12 points.

•  Weapons:  Vehicle  weapons  are  based  on  various
attack  effects,  particularly  Damage  with  various
modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may
mount versions of some of the weapons listed else-
where in this chapter.

A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole
team, particularly useful for shuttling around team mem-

bers  who  cannot  fly  or  move  at  super-speed. The  mem-
bers of the team divide the equipment point cost of the
vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the neces-
sary  ranks  of  the  Equipment  advantage  to  covering  the
vehicle’s cost.

Just like Alternate Equipment, characters may have mul-
tiple  vehicles. These  are  generally  Alternate  Equipment
by  definition,  since  it’s  difficult  to  drive  or  pilot  more
than one vehicle at a time! So the character pays the full
cost  for  the  most  expensive  vehicle,  and  then  1  equip-
ment point for each additional vehicle with the same or
lesser cost.

So a hero with an array of vehicles, such as a plane, boat,
and  car  pays  full  equipment  point  cost  for  the  most  ex-
pensive  of  the  vehicles  and  just  1  equipment  point  for
each  of  the  others.  The  hero’s  player  can  even  spend  a

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

Subtle:  As  a  mental  sensory  effect,  Mind  Reading  has  a
degree  of  subtlety,  only  noticeable  to  the  subject  or  to
characters  with  an  appropriate  mental  sense,  such  as
Mental  Awareness  (see  the  Senses  effect).  Subtle  Mind
Reading is less detectable, requiring a DC 20 Perception
check  for  either  type  of  character  to  sense  it,  while  two
ranks  of  the  Subtle  modifier  makes  your  Mind  Reading
completely undetectable. Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Close: Applied to Ranged Mind Reading, Close Mind Read-
ing requires a close attack check to touch an unwilling tar-
get and physical contact throughout the effect’s duration;
breaking contact ends the effect. –1 cost per rank.

Feedback: You suffer Feedback if a subject you are reading
is harmed, using your Mind Reading rank as the resistance
check  bonus  against  the  damage.  Additionally,  you  may
suffer Feedback at the GM’s discretion from reading or ex-
periencing  particularly  traumatic  or  emotionally-charged
thoughts of memories from the subject. –1 cost per rank.

Limited by Language: You can only understand the sub-
ject’s thoughts or memories if you share a common lan-
guage. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Emotions: You can only read or probe for emo-
tions and emotional associations, not coherent thoughts
or memories. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Sensory Link: If you have the Sensory Link extra
and this flaw, you can only tap into a subject’s senses, you
cannot read their thoughts or memories. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Surface Thoughts: You can only read surface
thoughts and cannot achieve higher degrees of contact.
–1 cost per rank.

Ranged: Ranged Mind Reading requires a ranged attack
check in addition to the effect’s normal resistance check.
–1 cost per rank.

Sense-Dependent: Your Mind Reading is dependent on
a  sense  other  than  just  having  to  accurately  sense  the
target, such as needing to see his expressions (Sight-De-
pendent), hear him speak (Hearing-Dependent), smell his
changes in biochemistry (Scent-Dependent), and so forth.
Alternately, it may be dependent on first being in Mental
Communication with the target (see Communication). –1

Insulating Fur: You have a layer of fur that protects
you from intense heat and cold, giving you immunity

Internal Compartment: You can carry a portion of
your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a
pouch  or  compartment  of  some  sort,  able  to  hold
objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than
your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).

Iron  Stomach: You  can  eat  anything  that’s  not  toxic
without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be:
spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.

•  Mimicry: You can imitate almost any sound you’ve
heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks
to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.

The  Feature  effect  is  intended  to  round  out  various
minor traits and abilities characters might have, but it
is entirely optional and not meant to burden MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS character design with needless amounts
of detail. It’s for traits with an actual game effect, not
merely  descriptors  or  background  color  (neither  of
which should cost any points). Ultimately, the Game-
master  decides  what  traits  merit  a  rank  (or  more)  of
Feature and what Features are permitted for any given
game or setting, using the examples given here.

If  a  “feature”  is  something  likely  to  come  up  only
occasionally, or even just once, then you are better
off  allowing  it  as  an  aspect  of  the  inspiration  and
power  stunt  rules  (see  the  Characteristics  chap-
ter), charging the player a hero point for the feature
when it comes into play. The player can then choose
whether  or  not  to  use  earned  power  points  to  ac-
quire the Feature as a regular part of the character’s
traits later on.

pass through solid objects permeable to your type of en-
ergy, but energy resistant barriers, like heavy shielding or
force fields, block your movement.
RANK 4 - INCORPOREAL

You  can  assume  a  less  solid  form,  with  each  Insubstantial
rank becoming progressively less solid. You do not gain the
ability to assume lower-ranked Insubstantial forms at higher
ranks, but you can acquire a lower-ranked form as an Alter-
nate Effect of a higher-ranked one. You can switch between
normal and Insubstantial form at will as a free action once
per  round.  The  default  is  that  substantial  is  your “normal”
form, but the GM may permit you to make Insubstantial your
“normal” form, in which case remaining solid is a sustained
duration for you! Insubstantial offers four ranks of effect:

You  become  an  incorporeal  phantom.  You  can  pass
through solid matter at your normal speed and you have
Immunity to Physical and Energy Damage. Sensory effects
(other than tactile) and those targeting Will still work on
you,  as  do  effects  with  the  Affects  Insubstantial  modi-
fier. Choose one other reasonably common effect or de-
scriptor that works on you while you are incorporeal. You
have no effective Strength and cannot affect the physical
world, except with effects with the Affects Corporeal mod-
ifier. Your sensory effects work normally.

RANK 1 - FLUID

You become a fluid mass. You can flow through any sort of
opening,  under  (or  around)  doors,  through  keyholes  and
pipes,  and  so  forth.  You  cannot  pass  through  watertight
seals. You can automatically flow out of any restraint—such
as a snare or grab—that is not watertight. So you cannot flow
out of a bubble completely enclosing you, for example, but
anything  less  cannot  hold  you. You  can  exert  your  normal
Strength and can still push or carry objects, although your
manual dexterity may be limited (at the GM’s discretion).

A  fluid  character  may  attempt  to  catch  a  falling  person
or  object,  cushioning  the  fall  with  the  character’s  flex-
ible  form. This  requires  a  move  action,  and  reduces  the
falling damage by the cushioning character’s Toughness
bonus (representing flexibility in this case). Both charac-
ters  must  make  resistance  checks  against  the  remaining
damage. Higher rank insubstantial forms—lacking physi-
cal Strength—cannot attempt this.

of coordination or complex maneuvering.

Deception:  Good  for  effects  intended  to  deceive,
particularly sensory effects like Concealment or Illu-

Side Effect: As a particular side effect of Luck Control, if
your  effort  to  alter  luck  fails,  you  suffer  a  setback  with-
out earning a hero point. Effectively the GM gains a “free”

SENSORY

Effect:  Perception  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Re-
sisted by Will • 4 points per rank

You  can  impose  your  will  on  others,  forcing  them  to
obey  your  commands. Targets  failing  a Will  resistance
check against your effect DC first become dazed, then
compelled, as they try to fight off your influence. Finally,
with  three  or  more  degrees  of  effect,  the  target  be-
comes controlled and obeys any commands you give.

Degrees  of  failure  on  resistance  checks  against  Mind
Control are cumulative. You can also apply the Progres-
sive modifier (see the Affliction effect) so your mental
hold  increases  each  time  the  target  fails  a  resistance
check against it!

Action: Standard • Range: Perception
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 point per rank

MIMIC

You can read another character’s mind. To use Mind Read-
ing,  make  an  opposed  effect  check  against  the  result  of
the target’s Will check. The degree of success determines
the degree of contact:

Surface  thoughts: You  can  read  what  the
target  is  presently  thinking.  Mind  Reading
transcends language; you comprehend the
target’s thoughts whether or not you share
a common language.

Personal thoughts: You can probe deeper
into  the  target’s  mind  for  information. You
can  essentially  ask  any  one  question  and
receive  the  answer  from  the  target’s  mind.
If the target doesn’t know the answer, then
you know that as well.

Memory: You can read the subject’s memo-
ries  and  recollections.  This  allows  you  to
perceive  them  exactly  as  the  target  recalls
them, one memory per round.

Subconscious:  You  can  read  memories
from the target’s subconscious, things even
the  target  does  not  consciously  know. This
might mean repressed or hidden memories,
deep-seated psychological traumas, or even

Levitation: You can only move vertically, straight up and

self to be carried along in the direction of the wind hori-
zontally. –1 cost per rank.

Platform: Your Flight is reliant on some sort of platform on
which  you  stand  or  sit.  If  you  fail  a  resistance  check  while
flying,  or  you  are  grabbed  by  someone  standing  on  the
ground, you’re knocked or pulled off your platform and can-
not fly. You can regain the use of your flying platform by reac-
tivating your Flight effect on your next turn. –1 cost per rank.

Wings: You have wings that allow you to fly, but they run
the risk of being fouled or restrained, which prevents you
from flying. If you are immobilized, restrained, or bound,
you cannot fly. You can regain the use of your wings by
reactivating  your  Flight  effect  once  you  are  no  longer
affected  by  the  aforementioned  conditions.  –1  cost

GROWTH

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily increase your size, gaining Strength
and  Stamina  at  the  cost  of  becoming  a  bigger,  heavier,
less agile target, unable to maneuver through small spac-
es. Growth modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

Each  rank  of  Growth  adds  1  rank  to  your  Strength  and
Stamina  (constructs  add  1  rank  to  Strength  and Tough-
ness if they lack Stamina) and adds 1 rank to your mass.
Every  two  ranks  adds  a  +1  bonus  to  Intimidation.  Every
8 ranks adds 1 to your Speed. Every rank of Growth sub-
tracts 1 from your Stealth checks. Every 2 ranks (rounded
up) subtracts 1 from your Dodge and Parry defenses. Ev-
ery  4  ranks  of  Growth  increases  your  size  rank  by  1  (or-
dinary humans start out at size rank –2, between 3 and
6  feet  tall).  So  at  Growth  8,  you  have  +8  Strength  and
Stamina,  +4  to  Intimidation,  +1  Speed,  but  -8  to
Stealth,  –4  Dodge  and  Parry,  and  you  are  size
rank 0 (around 30 feet tall). Increases to your
Strength and Stamina also improve related
traits like your Strength Damage, Forti-
tude, and Toughness.

LIGHT

You  can  raise  the  light  level  in  the  area,  countering  the
concealment of darkness, but not other forms of conceal-
ment. For 1 point per rank, you can create enough light to
reduce  total  concealment  to  partial  and  partial  conceal-
ment  to  none.  For  2  points  per  rank,  you  can  shed  light
as bright as a sunlit day, eliminating all concealment pro-
vided  by  natural  darkness.  Power  effects  with  the  dark-
ness descriptor may be countered with a successful power
check (see Countering Effects, page 148).

You impose a -2 modifier to Perception checks for 1 point
per rank, and a -5 for 2 points per rank. For more signifi-
cant  obscuring  of  senses  (via  darkness,  fog,  etc.)  use  an
Area Concealment Attack effect (see Concealment in this
chapter).
EXTRAS

Selective: With this extra you can vary the environment
within your affected area, affecting some while not affect-
ing  others,  or  even  mixing  and  matching  different  envi-
ronments (making part of the area cold and another hot,
for example). +1 cost per rank.

GENERAL

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  have  extra  manipulative  limbs,  such  as  arms,  tenta-
cles, or even prehensile hair or a tail. Each rank in this ef-
fect grants you an extra limb.

Extra  Limbs  do  not  allow  you  to  take  additional  actions
in a round, although they do provide the benefits of the
Improved Grab advantage—grabbing with some of your
limbs and leaving others free. All additional limbs except
your dominant limb are considered your “off-hand.” If you
have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you have no
off-hand penalties with any of your limbs.

If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than
taking the option to leave some of them free), you gain a

HOOD: EXTRA LIMBS, NOT EXTRA ACTIONS

As a default, Extra Limbs do not grant characters the abil-
ity to take extra actions in a round, simply because multi-
ple actions—especially extra standard actions usable for
attacks—tend to slow down and unbalance play.

As  an  option  for  including  some  combat  benefits  with
Extra  Limbs,  consider  allowing  the  application  of  the
Multiattack extra to the Strength of a character with Extra
Limbs, reflecting the ability to launch a flurry of attacks
at a single opponent, or to “spread” those attacks among
a number of nearby opponents. See the Multiattack de-

Flat +1 point.

Randomize: Rather than being countered, the effect(s) tar-
geted by your Nullify acquire the Uncontrolled flaw and go
out of control (as dictated by the GM). +0 cost per rank.

lows you to choose who in the area is affected, nullifying
some targets and not others. +1 cost per rank.

Sustained:  If  this  modifier  is  applied  to  Concentration
Nullify, keeping the countered effect(s) suppressed is only
a free action for you each turn. +1 cost per rank.

Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

Protection shields you against damage, giving you +1 to
your Toughness  defense  per  rank.  So  Protection  4  gives
you +4 Toughness.

FLAWS

Sustained:  Your  Protection  is  a  sustained  effect,  rather
than permanent. The effect can be turned on and off and
can be improved using extra effort, including using it to
perform  stunts  (see  Extra  Effort).  Sustained  Protection
might be a power like a personal force field, or the ability
to consciously harden your skin and turn it into armor. +0
cost per rank.

QUICKNESS

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  can  perform  routine  tasks—anything  that  can  be
done as a routine check (see Routine Checks in The Ba-
sics  chapter)—fast,  perhaps  very  fast.  Subtract  your  ef-
fect rank from the normal time rank to perform a task to
determine how long it takes you. So, for example, if you
have Quickness 7, a routine task normally taking an hour
(time rank 9) takes you (9 – 7 = time rank 2) 30 seconds.
Non-routine checks are not affected by Quickness, nor is
movement speed.

If you can perform a task in less than a second (time rank
–2), the GM may choose to treat that task as a free action
for you (although the GM can still limit the number of free
actions you can accomplish in a turn as usual).

Effect: Variable (assumed forms), Move Action • 8 points

You  can  transform  into  different  forms,  gaining  the
physical  traits  (abilities,  skills,  advantages,  and  pow-
ers) of the assumed form. You gain (Shapeshift rank x 5)
power points worth of traits. You can also redistribute
points spent on your own physical traits (lowering your
Strength to apply those points elsewhere, for example).
You are limited to the inherent traits of the forms you
assume and do not gain new mental traits, even if that
form possesses them.

Shapeshift is often further Limited by the specific types
of forms the character can assume, such as Limited to
Animals or Limited to Machines.

ter’s perceptions are unreliable, the sense appears to work,
but the character gets the wrong information. For this rea-
son, the GM should make all reliability checks for Senses
in secret, just informing the player of what the character
does (or does not) notice. –1 cost per rank.

SHRINKING

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily decrease your size, becoming smaller,
harder to see — and hit — at the cost of losing Strength
and  speed.  Every  4  ranks  of  Shrinking  reduces  your  size
rank by 1 (normal humans are size rank –2 by default) and
each reduction in size rank subtracts 1 from your Strength
and every two reductions in size rank subtract 1 from your
ground speed rank. Add half your Shrinking rank (rounded
down)  to  your  active  defenses.  Add  your  Shrinking  rank
as a bonus to Stealth checks, since you are harder to spot,
but apply half your rank (rounded down) as a penalty to In-
timidation checks (hard to be imposing when you’re tiny).
Shrinking modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

So  at  Shrinking  12,  you  are  size  rank  –5  (about  6  inches
tall),  and  have  a  +6  bonus  to  active  defenses  and  +12
Stealth bonus, but –3 Strength, –1 speed, and –6 Intimida-
tion penalties.
EXTRAS

Atomic: At Shrinking 20 (and size rank –7), you can shrink
down to the molecular or even atomic level, allowing you
to pass through solid objects by slipping between their at-
oms. It takes at least a full turn to do so, possibly longer for
larger objects. You’re effectively immune to damage and
many effects at this scale, since you are essentially shifted
out of the ordinary universe. The GM decides if a particular
effect can reach you at the atomic level. If you have

(or set of uncommon effects) that keeps you from recov-
ering from death, such as beheading, cremation, a stake
through the heart, and so forth. Even then, if the effect is
somehow removed or reversed (e.g. the stake is removed
from your corpse) you may still be able to come back. -1

IMMUNITY

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding
on  any  resistance  check  against  them. You  assign  ranks  of
Immunity to various effects to gain immunity to them (with
more extensive effects requiring more ranks). These assign-
ments are permanent. Examples include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

1  rank:  aging,  disease,  poison,  one  environmental
condition  (cold,  heat,  high  pressure,  radiation,  or
vacuum), one type of suffocation (breathe normally
underwater or in an alien atmosphere, for example),
starvation and thirst, need for sleep, or a rare power
descriptor (such as your own powers, a close sibling’s
powers, etc.).

2 ranks: critical hits, suffocation effects (no need to
breathe  at  all),  or  an  uncommon  power  descriptor
(such as chemical, gravitic, necromantic, etc.).

5 ranks: alteration effects, sensory Affliction effects,
emotion  effects,  entrapment  (grabbing,  snares,  or
bonds), fatigue effects, interaction skills, or a particu-
lar  Damage  effect,  descriptor  (such  as  bullets,  cold,
electricity, falling, fire, magic, radiation, sonic, etc.)

10 ranks: a common power descriptor (such as all ef-
fects with cold, electricity, fire, radiation, or weather
descriptors,  for  example),  life  support  (includes  im-
munity  to  disease,  poison,  all  environmental  condi-
tions, suffocation, and starvation and thirst).

20  ranks:  a  very  common  power  descriptor  (blud-
geoning or energy, for example).

30 ranks: All effects resisted by Fortitude, All effects
resisted by Will.

•

80  ranks:  All  effects  resisted  by  Toughness  (the
equivalent of 40 ranks of Impervious Toughness).

Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For exam-
ple, “immunity to cold” can range from the environmen-
tal effects of cold (described under The Environment) to

manoids, animals, machines, and so forth. At rank 4 you
can assume any form of the same mass as your own.

For the ability to change size as well as appearance see the
Growth and Shrinking effects. To take on the other traits of
forms you assume, see the Metamorph extra, following, or
the Variable effect, later in this chapter.
EXTRAS

Attack:  A  Morph  Attack  imposes  a  different  appearance
on  the  target  creature.  Unlike  an  Affliction  that  imposes
the transformed condition, a Morph Attack is entirely cos-
metic: you can’t change the target’s traits other than ap-
pearance. +0 cost per rank.

Metamorph:  Morph  only  changes  your  appearance;  you
still  have  all  the  traits  of  your  normal  form. This  modifier
allows  you  to  have  an  alternate  set  of  traits,  essentially  a
complete  alternate  character  you  change  into,  one  set  of
traits per rank in Metamorph. You can switch between sets
of traits at will, once per round, as a free action. Your other
form(s) must have the same point total as you and are sub-
ject  to  the  same  power  level  limits. They  must  also  have
traits  suitable  to  your  Morph  effect.  For  example,  if  you
can only Morph into humanoid forms, then your alternate
forms all have to be humanoid. All of your forms must have
your full Morph effect as well; those power points cannot
be reallocated. The GM may require certain additional com-
mon traits for all of your forms, particularly mental abilities
and skills, if you retain them. Metamorph is best suited to
characters with defined sets of alternate traits. For a char-
acter able to transform into a virtually unlimited number of
forms with various traits, see the Variable effect later in this
chapter. Flat +1 point per rank of Metamorph.
FLAWS

Resistible: A Morph effect Resistible by Will is most likely
a mental illusion of some sort. Observers who succeed on
the Will  resistance  check  see  you  as  you  truly  are  rather
than in your Morph guise. This is in addition to the usual
Perception check to penetrate your disguise. If you have
the Metamorph extra, then targets that resist your effect
treat you as if you had your normal traits, and not those
granted by your Metamorph form. –1 cost per rank.

noticeable as constructs for 1 rank (they look just like real
objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects
composed of invisible force). Flat +1or 2 points.

details). -1 cost per rank.

Permanent:  Permanent  created  objects  last  until  de-
stroyed or nullified. Unlike Continuous Create, you cannot
choose to dismiss such objects; they are truly permanent.
You  cannot  repair  permanent  created  objects  or  other-
wise alter them once they’re created. +0 cost per rank (for
a Sustained effect).

Proportional: Your  created  objects  have  a  total  volume
rank plus Toughness rank equal to your Create rank, rather

than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you
can create an object with volume rank 0 and Toughness
equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in be-
tween, so long as the sum of the two ranks does not ex-
ceed your Create rank. –1 cost per rank.

DAZZLE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Limited  to  One
Sense • 2 points per rank

You can overwhelm one of the target’s senses, chosen
when  you  take  this  effect.  The  target  makes  a  Forti-
tude  or  Will  resistance  check  against  your  effect  DC
(choose one when you acquire the effect). One degree
of failure leaves the sense impaired (–2 penalty). Two
degrees leave it disabled (–5 penalty) while three de-
grees  leave  the  sense  unaware: The  target  automati-
cally fails Perception checks involving the sense, and
everything effectively has total concealment from that
sense.

The target makes a new resistance check at the end of
each  turn  to  recover.  Success  removes  the  condition
imposed by the Dazzle power. Failure

FLAWS

Limited  to  One  Type:  Your  Quickness  applies  to  only
physical or mental tasks, not both. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to One Task: Your Quickness applies to only one
particular  task,  such  as  reading,  mathematical  calcula-
tions, and so forth. –2 cost per rank.

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You recover quickly from damage. Remove penalties to
your  Toughness  checks  due  to  damage  equal  to  your
Regeneration rank each minute. You then recover other
damage  conditions  equal  to  your  Regeneration  rank
each minute, starting from your most severe condition.
Spread  this  recovery  out  evenly  over  a  minute  (10  ac-
tion  rounds).  So  with  Regeneration  5,  you  remove  a  –1
Toughness penalty every other round (every round with
Regeneration 10, and up to a –2 penalty per round with
Regeneration 20).

Characters  with  no  Stamina  do  not  heal  (see  Absent
Abilities in the Abilities chapter). One or more ranks of
Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character
with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate; additional
Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.
EXTRAS

Persistent:  You  can  regenerate  even  Incurable  damage
conditions (see the Incurable modifier). +1 cost per rank.
FLAWS

Source: Your Regeneration only works when you have ac-
cess  to  a  particular  source  to  replenish  yourself,  such  as
blood, electricity, sand, scrap metal, sunlight, and so forth.
–1 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Rank
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–5 points per rank

You can displace one or more of your senses over a dis-
tance, perceiving as if you were at that location, up to 60
feet away. Each additional rank increases your range one
distance rank, so rank 2 is 120 feet, rank 3 is 250 feet, and
so  on.  Remote  Sensing  overrides  your  normal  sense(s)
while  you  are  using  it.  Subjects  observed  via  Remote
Sensing can “feel” it with an Insight check (DC 10 + rank).

You can make Perception checks normally using your dis-
placed senses, taking the normal action to do so. To search
a  large  area  for  someone  or  something,  use  the  search

Quickness,  like  many  power  effects,  is  not  especially
realistic;  it  allows  you  to  do  things  like  disassemble
an  entire  car  as  a  free  action  at  a  high  enough  rank
(around  rank  13-14),  but  doesn’t  have  any  effect  on

Effect: Damage, Reaction • 4 points per rank

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You can surround your body with an aura of damaging
energy or some similar effect. Anyone you touch or that
touches you must make a Toughness resistance check
against your aura’s Damage rank. You can turn your aura
on and off at will as a free action. If your Aura damages
some targets but not others, apply the Selective or Lim-
ited modifiers (depending on whether or not the selec-
tivity is under your control).

Reduced Trait: One or more of your traits is lowered while
others  are  enhanced. This  flaw  is  worth  as  many  points
as  the  reduction  in  the  affected  trait(s).  So,  for  example,
if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the
value  of  the  lost  Intellect  ranks  as  the  value  of  the  flaw.
As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power
point. Flat –points equal to the lowered trait.

You can generate and project a type of energy, such as
cold, electricity, fire, kinetic force, magnetism, radiation,
or  even  cosmic  energy,  in  a  damaging  blast  (see  the
Blast power).

Energy Control is further defined by the addition of Alter-
nate Effects (see Alternate Effects, page 188), expand-
ing what you can do with your control. For example, Cold
Control  might  let  you  lower  the  surrounding  tempera-
ture (Environment – Cold) or trap targets in ice (Affliction,
see  the  Snare  version).  Magnetic  Control  could  let  you
manipulate metallic objects (Limited Move Object) while
Electrical Control lets you generate an electrical pulse to
overload electronics (Burst Area Nullify Electronics). Add
as many Alternate Effects to your Energy Control as you
can afford, and consider some additional ones as options
for power stunts (see Powers Stunts, page 20).

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Rank
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–2 points per rank

You  can  change  the  environment  in  an  area:  raising  or
lowering  the  temperature,  creating  light,  causing  rain,
and so forth (see The Environment in the Action & Ad-
venture chapter for details).

Your  Environment  affects  a  30  foot  radius  around  you
at rank 1. Each additional rank moves the radius up one
distance rank, for a reach of approximately 2,000 miles at
rank  20,  sufficient  to  alter  the  environment  of  an  entire
continent!

Effect: Ranged, Progressive Affliction, Resisted by Forti-
tude • 4 points per rank

You  render  the  target  unable  to  breathe.  Targets  fail-
ing  the  Fortitude  resistance  check  against  your  effect
DC become dazed, stunned, and finally incapacitated,
passing out from the lack of oxygen. A failed attempt
to  resist  the  ongoing  effect  of  Suffocation  causes  the
target’s condition to worsen by one degree.

ent than “heat ray” is a descriptor for a Damage effect or
“sticky webbing” is a descriptor for a hindering Affliction;
in  neither  case  does  the  character  need  Summon  Heat
Ray or Summon Webbing to create the desired powers!

SWIMMING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-
scribe it, such as “inside the capitol building lobby” or “atop
the  Emerald  Tower’s  roof.”  If  the  destination  isn’t  in  your
Teleport range, nothing happens. +1 cost per rank.

EXTRAS

Action: This extra reduces the action required for you to
use Healing. You cannot use Healing more than once per
turn  regardless. To  heal  multiple  subjects  at  once,  apply
the Area modifier. +1 cost per rank.

Affects Objects: Your Healing can also “heal” damage to
non-living  subjects.  You  make  a  Healing  check  against
the subject’s worst damage condition, as normal. +1 cost
per rank.

Area: Healing with this extra grants the same benefit to all
subjects in the affected area. Area Empathic Healing (see
this power’s Flaws) is an unwise combination, as the heal-
er takes on all of the damage conditions of the affected
subjects at once! +1 cost per rank.

Energizing: You can heal the fatigued and exhausted con-
ditions as well as damage conditions: DC 10, one degree of
success for fatigued, two degrees of success for exhausted.
However, you take on the removed conditions and cannot
use  Healing  to  eliminate  your  own  fatigue  (although  you
can still use hero points to recover from them). If the Heal-
ing check fails, you must wait the normal recovery time or
use extra effort to try again. +1 cost per rank.

Perception: Applied to Ranged Healing (following), Per-
ception Ranged Healing does not require an attack check
to “touch” the subject. +1 cost per rank.

Persistent: Your  Healing  can  remove  even  Incurable  ef-
fects (see the Incurable modifier). Flat +1 point.

Ranged:  Ranged  Healing  requires  an  attack  check  to
“touch” the subject with the Healing effect. The GM may
waive the check for a willing subject holding completely
still, but the subject is defenseless that round, making it an
unwise decision in the midst of combat. +1 cost per rank.

recover from it normally. You can use Healing and Regen-
eration to cure your own conditions. You can have the Res-
urrection modifier for Healing, but if you successfully use
it, you die! This may not be as bad as it seems if you have
Immortality, allowing you to return to life (see the Immor-
tality effect for details). –1 cost per rank.

Limited: Examples of ways in which Healing may be Lim-
ited include: One Type of Damage (such as energy or blud-
geoning  damage),  Objects  (in  conjunction  with  Affects
Objects), Others (you can’t use Healing on yourself), or Self
(you can only use Healing on yourself). –1 cost per rank.

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while Sum-
mon  conjures  creatures  of  some  sort,  capable  of  inde-
pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless
creatures  like  ro

Armor: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addi-
tion to its normal Toughness, possibly including Imper-
vious  Protection.  Some  vehicles  may  have  Sustained
Protection (such as force screens) instead of, or in addi-
tion to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.

Cloaking Device: A vehicle may have a “cloaking de-
vice” granting Concealment from visual senses. Some
vehicles  may  also  have  Concealment  from  auditory
senses or things such as radar, giving them a “stealth
mode.” 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense
type) or 8 points (all visual senses).

Immunity:  Vehicles  normally  provide
immunity
to  the  normal  hazards  of  environments  they  travel
through—such  as  underwater  or  in  space—at  no
additional  cost.  Additional  Immunity  effects  are  for
unusual hazards or circumstances, such as a car that
provides  a  sealed  air  system,  granting  immunity  to
suffocation and other atmospheric hazards.

Smokescreen:  The  vehicle  can  release  a  cloud  of
thick smoke or mist that provides an Area visual Con-
cealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pur-
suers. 12 points.

•  Weapons:  Vehicle  weapons  are  based  on  various
attack  effects,  particularly  Damage  with  various
modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may
mount versions of some of the weapons listed else-
where in this chapter.

A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole
team, particularly useful for shuttling around team mem-

bers  who  cannot  fly  or  move  at  super-speed. The  mem-
bers of the team divide the equipment point cost of the
vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the neces-
sary  ranks  of  the  Equipment  advantage  to  covering  the
vehicle’s cost.

Just like Alternate Equipment, characters may have mul-
tiple  vehicles. These  are  generally  Alternate  Equipment
by  definition,  since  it’s  difficult  to  drive  or  pilot  more
than one vehicle at a time! So the character pays the full
cost  for  the  most  expensive  vehicle,  and  then  1  equip-
ment point for each additional vehicle with the same or
lesser cost.

So a hero with an array of vehicles, such as a plane, boat,
and  car  pays  full  equipment  point  cost  for  the  most  ex-
pensive  of  the  vehicles  and  just  1  equipment  point  for
each  of  the  others.  The  hero’s  player  can  even  spend  a

using the device beyond that, he must pay power points
to make the device part of his regular abilities. Otherwise
the GM can simply rule that the device is lost, reclaimed
by its owner, runs out of power, breaks down, or whatever,
and is therefore no longer accessible. Characters with the
Inventor  and  Artificer  advantages  can  create  temporary
devices for use in an adventure.

Gamemasters  may  require  characters  to  spend  a  hero
point to make temporary use of a device that doesn’t be-
long to them, similar to performing a power stunt without
suffering fatigue. This helps to limit the loaning and tem-
porary use of devices.

A  common  staple  of  comic  books  is  the  battlesuit,  also
known  as  power-armor.  It  is  an  advanced  suit  of  tech-
nological  (sometime  magical)  armor,  giving  the  wearer
various powers. Battlesuits commonly grant the following
powers:

•

•

•

Armor:  Protection  is  the  foundation  power  for  a
battlesuit. Whether it is armor plating, metallic mesh,
flexible  ballistic  material,  or  some  combination  of
these and other cutting-edge technologies, a battle-
suit  protects  its  wearer  from  damage.  Some  battle-
suits provide Impervious Protection and some have
Sustained  Protection  in  the  form  of  built-in  force
fields or the like.

Attacks:  Battlesuits  are  typically  equipped  with
some kind of weapon or weapons, based around var-
ious attack effects, particularly Damage. A battlesuit
with an array of weapons may have a primary attack
effect and several others as Alternate Effects (see the
Alternate Effect modifier in the Powers chapter).

Immunity: A part of the protection a battlesuit offers
is  a  sealed  environment,  offering  Immunity  to  vari-
ous conditions and hazards.

•  Movement:  After  defense  and  offense,  battlesuits
typically allow the wearer to get around, whether it’s
hydraulic-assisted  Leaping,  boot-jets  or  anti-gravity
repulsion for Flight, turbines for Swimming, or some

other movement effect.

•

Sensors:  Battlesuits  often  come
equipped with a suite of sensors providing
Senses. Darkvision, direction sense (pos-
sibly from a global positioning system),
infrared vision, radio, time sense (from
a  chronometer),  and  ultra-hearing  are
all common battlesuit sensors.

•  Strength: A battlesuit might have ser-
vomotors  or  other  mechanisms  to  mag-
nify  the  wearer’s  Strength. This  is  typically  a
combination of Enhanced Stren

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Ranged, Progressive Affliction, Resisted by Forti-
tude • 4 points per rank

You  render  the  target  unable  to  breathe.  Targets  fail-
ing  the  Fortitude  resistance  check  against  your  effect
DC become dazed, stunned, and finally incapacitated,
passing out from the lack of oxygen. A failed attempt
to  resist  the  ongoing  effect  of  Suffocation  causes  the
target’s condition to worsen by one degree.

ent than “heat ray” is a descriptor for a Damage effect or
“sticky webbing” is a descriptor for a hindering Affliction;
in  neither  case  does  the  character  need  Summon  Heat
Ray or Summon Webbing to create the desired powers!

SWIMMING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-
scribe it, such as “inside the capitol building lobby” or “atop

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

TRANSFORM

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2-5 points per rank

You can change objects into other objects, altering their
shape  or  material  composition  in  the  process. You  must
touch  the  chosen  object,  which  requires  a  close  attack
check if the object is held or worn by another character.

What you can transform affects cost per rank:

•

2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one
other thing or substance, such as metal into wood,
iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.

Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands
of a cunning player. To a degree, Transform can dupli-
cate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by
transforming air into a solid material or turning oxygen
into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). This is perfectly
allowable; use the rules for other effects as guidelines
on how to handle these situations, using Transform rank
to determine resistance DCs.

Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained
duration, which may affect how such “tricks” work (e.g.,
the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffo-
cating gas dissipates unless the character concentrates
each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always,
the GM should use common sense and good judgment.

You  may  wish  to  require  characters  using  Transform
to  acquire  money  (gold,  precious  gems,  etc.)  or  other
permanent  material  goods  to  spend  power  points  on
ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain imperma-
nent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter
in your series in some way.)

It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects:
turning a steel door into water, air, or even rust certain-
ly  removes  it  as  a  barrier.  However,  keep  in  mind  that
Transform  is  normally  sustained;  the  target  isn’t  truly
destroyed unless the effect is continuous, and therefore
irreversible. Even then, the destruction of targets tends
to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of wearing-
down  and  eventually  destroying  objects,  use  Weaken
Toughness instead.

Transforming living or otherwise animate beings as op-
posed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than
Transform. To alter a target’s outward appearance only,
go  with  a  Morph  Attack  (see  the  Morph  effect).  For  a
harmful effect that does something like turn the target

speed in the round, regardless of the number of attacks
you  make. You  stop  attacking  once  you  miss,  run  out  of
movement, or there are no more minions within range of
your attack.

You can transfer the benefits of a successful combat use of
an interaction skill to your teammate(s). For example, you
can feint and have your target vulnerable against one or
more allies next attack(s), rather than yours. Each rank in
the advantage lets you transfer the benefit to one ally. The
interaction skill check requires its normal action, and the
affected allies must be capable of interacting with you (or
at least seeing the set-up) to benefit from it.

SKILL

You  can  demoralize  an  opponent  with  Deception  rather
than  Intimidation  (see  Demoralize  under  the  Intimida-
tion skill description), disparaging and undermining con-
fidence  rather  than  threatening. Targets  resist  using  De-

GENERAL, RANKED

TEAMWORK

GENERAL

You  have  another  character  serving  as  your  partner  and
aide.  Create  your  sidekick  as  an  independent  character
with (advantage rank x 5) power points, and subject to the
series power level. A sidekick’s power point total must be
less than yours. Your sidekick is an NPC, but automatically
helpful  and  loyal  to  you.  Gamemasters  should  generally
allow you to control your sidekick, although sidekicks re-
main NPCs and the GM has final say in their actions.

Sidekicks  do  not  earn  power  points.  Instead,  you  must
spend earned power points to increase your rank in Side-
kick to improve the sidekick’s power point total and traits;
each  point  you  spend  to  increase  your  rank  in  Sidekick
grants  the  sidekick  5  additional  power  points.  Sidekicks
also do not have hero points, but you can spend your own
hero points on the sidekick’s behalf with the usual bene-
fits. Sidekicks are not minions, but full-fledged characters,
so they are not subject to the minion rules.

You’re  effective  at  helping  out  your  friends.  When  you
support a team check (see Team Checks in The Basics
chapter)  you  have  a  +5  circumstance  bonus  to  your
check.  This  bonus  also  applies  to  the  Aid  action  and

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

245

A successful attack has some effect on the target. Typical-
ly this is an effect from the Powers chapter, such as Dam-
age or Affliction. The effect has a rank, used to determine
a difficulty class for the target’s resistance check.

Resistance Difficulty = effect rank + 10

The target of the attack makes a resistance check against
the effect to determine what, if anything, happens.

Some  effects  are  not  resisted  just  once,  but  multiples
times. The later resistance checks represent how fast the
target is able to “shake off” the effect. Make a resistance
check  for  the  target  of  an  ongoing  effect  at  the  end  of
each  of  the  target’s  turns.  A  successful  check  ends  the
effect  and  removes  conditions  imposed  by  it.  A  failure
means  the  effect’s  conditions  persist,  as  given  in  the  ef-
fect’s description.

Example: Captain Thunder was hit by a Affliction
effect, leaving him blinded. At the end of his turn,
he makes a Fortitude resistance check against the
effect’s  DC  to  try  and  shake  it  off,  but  missed  the
check  by  2.  His  next  turn,  still  blind,  he  stumbles
and tries to strike the foe taunting him. At the end
of his turn, he makes another resistance check. Suc-
cess! He ends the Affliction effect and removes the
blinded condition. Next turn, the villain had better
watch out!

A  failed  resistance  check  against  an  attack  imposes  one
or more conditions on the target, depending on the type
of effect and the degree of failure. See the effect descrip-
tion and the Conditions section of The Basics chapter for
more on the various conditions.

ACTIONS

The  most  common  actions  characters  take  during  con-
flicts  are  listed  and  described  here.  The  GM  should  use
these as guidelines for dealing with unusual actions play-
ers may choose for their characters, basing them on the
existing action descriptions.

AID

If you are in position to attack an opponent, you can at-
tempt to aid an ally engaged in melee with that oppo-
nent as a standard action. This is like a team check (see
Team  Checks  in  The  Basics  chapter): You  make  an  at-
tack check against DC 10. If you succeed, you don’t actu-
ally hit or affect the opponent, but success grants your
ally  gains  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on  an  attack  check
against  that  opponent  or  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  to

Defense  against  that  opponent  (your  choice)  until  the
end  of  your  ally’s  next

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

Whether it’s an underground cave, the top floors of a skyscraper, a satellite in orbit, or a base on the Moon, many heroes
and villains maintain their own secret (or not so secret) headquarters. Teams may even pool their equipment points to
have a headquarters they share, with the Gamemaster’s approval.

A character can even have multiple bases of operation (see Alternate Headquarters later in this section). This is more
common for villains, who have back-up plans and secret bases they can retreat to when their plans are defeated. If a
character’s headquarters is destroyed, the character can choose to rebuild it or build a new headquarters with different
features using the same equipment points. Supervillains often go through a succession of different lairs.

Headquarters  have  two  main  traits—Size  and  Tough-
ness—and a number of possible Features. Each of these
costs equipment points.

SIZE

A structure’s size is measured similarly to that of a vehicle,
and gives a general idea of the overall space it occupies
and how much space is available inside it. See the Struc-
ture Size Categories table for guidelines. A headquarters
starts out at Small size for 0 points. Each increase in size
category  costs  1  point,  each  decrease  in  size  category

TOUGHNESS

A  headquarters’  Toughness  indicates  the  strength  of  its
structural materials, particularly its outer structure (walls,
ceiling, etc.). A structure starts out with Toughness 6 for 0
points. +2 Toughness costs 1 equipment point.

Some  features  refer  to  a  headquarters’  power  level.  For
player characters, this is the power level of the series over-
all.  For  non-player  characters,  particularly  villains,  this  is
the base-owner’s effective power level, or whatever pow-
er level the GM wishes to set, using the series power level
as a guideline.
