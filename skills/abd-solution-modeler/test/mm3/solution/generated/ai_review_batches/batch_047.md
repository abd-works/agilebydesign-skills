Effect only works about half the time (roll of 11 or more).

Example: A spellcaster has Senses 4 (Detect Magic,
Ranged,  Acute,  Analyze)  with  Expertise:  Magic
Check Required 4. The player needs to make a DC
13 skill check (10 + 3 additional ranks) to success-
fully cast the spell, followed by the normal Percep-
tion check to pick up on anything present, and per-
haps another Expertise check to interpret what the
character senses.

Skill checks an effect may require include:

Acrobatics: Suitable for effects requiring a measure
of coordination or complex maneuvering.

Deception:  Good  for  effects  intended  to  deceive,
particularly sensory effects like Concealment or Illu-
sion, and disguise or form-altering effects like Morph.

Expertise:  An  Expertise  skill  check  might  represent
having  to  know  something  about  the  subject  of  the
effect or having to kno

people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a
specific circumstance or complication may call for a dif-
ferent attitude.

You  can  improve  others’  attitudes  with  a  DC  15  Persua-
sion  check.  Success  improves  the  subject’s  attitude  by
one  step,  while  every  two  additional  degrees  of  success
improve it by another step (so two steps at three degrees,
three  steps  at  five  degrees,  and  so  forth).  Failure  means
no change, and more than a degree of failure worsens the
subject’s attitude by one step! In the case of a hostile sub-
ject, they may outright attack or otherwise interfere with
you if their attitude worsens.

ATTITUDES

ATTITUDE

EFFECT

Hostile

Will take risks to attack
or interfere with you.

Unfavorable

Will insult, mislead,
or otherwise cause you trouble.

Indifferent

Favorable

Helpful

Acts as socially expected
towards you.

Will chat, advise,
and offer limited help.

Will take risks to
help or protect you.

Persuading someone is at least a standard action, usually
quite a bit longer. The GM decides if you can persuade at
all once a conflict has broken out! Even if the initial check
succeeds,  the  other  character  can  only  be  persuaded  so
far;  you  can  try  again  in  the  same  scene,  but  you  check
against the subject’s initial attitude, and may end up wors-
ening it rather than improving it!

Example:  The  heroes  must  convince  the  imperi-
ous King of Atlantis that the surface world is not
responsible  for  recent  attacks  against  his  king-
dom  in  order  to  avert  a  war.  The  king’s  attitude
is  unfavorable  towards  these  surface-world  in-
terlopers  to begin with. The team’s spokesperson
makes  a  Persuasion  attempt  and  gets  a  check
result  of  22,  a  success  with  two  degrees  total.
That  shifts  the  king’s  attitude  one  step,  to  indif-
ferent. He’s inclined to continue negotiating with
the heroes and willing to place the assault on the
surface world on-hold for the time-being. The he-
roes try to convince the king further, but any ad-
ditional checks need at least the same degree of
success as the first to get his attitude to favorable,
where he is willing to call off the attack, and more
than one degree of failure on any check moves his
attitude to hostile, where he orders the intruders
arrested and the attack to begin at once!

ceed or fail, a target’s true attitude towards you generally
becomes hostile after you attempt an Intimidation check,
even if they go along with you for the moment.

You can use Intimidation in combat as a standard action
to undermine an opponent’s confidence. Make an Intimi-
dation check as a standard action. If it succeeds, your tar-
get is impaired (a –2 circumstance penalty on checks) un-
til the end of your next round. With four or more degrees
of success, the target is disabled (a –5 penalty) until the
end of your next round.

You can intimidate a whole group of minions—who can
all see and hear you—with a single check. If the group has
you at a disadvantage, you suffer the usual circumstance
penalty on your check. Compare your check result against
a single resistance check made by the GM for the entire
group. Your Intimidation check must have the same effect
on every member of the group (that is, you cannot demor-
alize some and coerce others, for example).

Example:  Rocky  is  facing  down  Pack-Rat  in  one
of his many bolt holes around Emerald City when
the big rat commands a pack of his street thieves
to keep Rocky from following him. The gang of kids
steps forward to get in Rocky’s way. Rocky has no
interest in hurting a bunch of kids, so he bellows,
“Get  outta  the  way  or  I’ll  knock  your  blocks  off!”
and his player decides to use Rocky’s routine Intimi-
dation check of 18 to attempt to coerce the entire
group of minions into moving out of his way. The
street kids are all Thugs, so they have a resistance
rank  of  0  (their  Insight  and  Will  ranks  are  tied).
Since Rocky is attempting the same effect on every
member of the group, he makes a single opposed
check. Unfortunately, the GM rolls a 13, which isn’t
enough  to  beat  Rocky’s  18.  The  street  kids  know
Rocky won’t actually hurt them, but they dive out
of the way anyway as Rocky bulls past.”

Intellect • Trained Only

You  know  how  to  search  for  and  study  clues,  gather  in-
formation through interviews and surveillance, and ana-
lyze evidence to help solve crimes. The GM may make In-
vestigation checks for you in secret, so you do not know
exactly what you have found, or if you may have missed
something.

SEARCH

You can search an area for clues, hidden items, traps, and
other details. Perception allows you to immediately notice
things, while an Investigation check allows you to pick up
on details with some effort.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

29

A lot of background details go into making your hero more than just a collection of numbers. Take a moment (if you
haven’t already) to consider some of the following things about your character:

NAME

What is your character’s name? That is to say, what is the
name  the  hero  uses  in  public,  that  appears  in  one-inch
type  in  the  newspaper  headlines?  Most  heroes  adopt
unique  and  distinctive “code  names,”  so  consider  a  suit-
able name for yours. Code names are often based on pow-
ers, theme, or style. Here are some options to consider:
ORIGIN

A name may be based on the hero’s origin, power source,
nation (or even world) of birth, and such.
POWERS

Choose a name based on the hero’s powers: Firestarter or
Blaze for a flame-controlling character, Thunder or Spark
for an electrical character, and so forth.

THEME

Maybe  the  character  has  a  theme  or  style  suggesting  a
name: Paladin might be a medieval knight displaced into
the present day, with a magical sword and armor. Madame
Macabre may be all about magic and the occult.

TITLES

Names  may  include  various  titles  like  Mister,  Miss,  Ms.,
Doctor,  Sir,  Lord,  Lady,  and  Madam  or  even  royal  titles
like  King,  Queen,  Prince,  Princess,  Duke,  Baron,  Emperor
and so forth. Military ranks are also popular parts of hero
names, especially General, Major, and Captain.
GENDER

Names often include gender designations like Man/Wom-
an, Boy/Girl, Lad/Lass, and so forth.
SOUND

Some  code-names  don’t  really  have  anything  to  do  with  a
character’s powers or background—they just sound cool: Kis-
met, Scion, Animus, Damask, and so forth. They may hint at
the hero’s powers or origin, or have nothing to do with them.

REAL NAME

Some heroes go by their given name, not using a code-
name at all. Oftentimes these names still sound like code-

names,  however.  They  may  also  be  nicknames,  such  as
“Dash” for someone with the name Dashell, or “Buzz” for
someone  with  the  name  Buzcinski,  or  whatever  other
nickname a character may have, such as “Stretch” or “Tiny”.

ORIGIN

What’s  the  origin  of  your  hero’s  powers?  It  can  be  any-
thing from a character born with the potential for powers
to someone granted them by an accident—exposure to a
strange meteor, radiation, genetic engineering, or any of
countless similar encounters. Here are some of the more
common superhero origins:
ACCIDENT

Perhaps  the  most  common  origin. The  hero

use of a tiring effect. In essence, the power requires extra
effort  in  order  to  use  it  (see  Extra  Effort,  page  19). This
makes Tiring a useful flaw for creating an effect you can
only use with extra effort.

Tiring is often applied to just some ranks of an effect to rep-
resent a higher level of the effect, usable only through extra
effort. For example, a hero might have a rank 12 Damage
effect, but routinely use only 8 ranks of it. The remaining
4 ranks are Tiring, so using them quickly fatigues the hero.

A Tiring effect can be combined with extra effort, but the
fatigue stacks, causing a minimum of two levels of fatigue
per use.

-1 COST PER RANK

You have no control over an effect with this flaw. Instead,
the Gamemaster decides when and how it works (essen-
tially  making  it  a  plot  device). This  flaw  is  best  suited  for
mysterious powers out of the characters’ direct control or
effects the GM feels more comfortable having under direct,
rather than player, control.

-1 COST PER RANK

An Unreliable effect doesn’t work all the time. Roll a die
each round before you use or maintain the effect. On a
10 or less, it doesn’t work this round, but you’ve still used
the action the effect requires. You can roll again on the
following  round  to  see  if  it  works,  although  you  must
take  the  normal  action  needed  to  activate  the  effect
again. Spending a hero point on your reliability roll al-

lows you to succeed automatically (since the roll is then
at least an 11).

Alternately,  instead  of  having  a  reliability  roll,  you  can
choose to have five uses where your effect works normal-
ly, then it stops working altogether until you can “recover”
it in some way (see the Fades flaw for more on this). The
GM may allow you to spend a hero point to automatically
recover a spent Unreliable power.

Powers  that  are  only  occasionally  unreliable  (less  than
about 50% of the time) are better handled as complica-
tions (see Complications, page 30).

One possible application of the Unreliable flaw is to re-
flect weapons or equipment that occasionally run out of
ammunition or “jam” or “crash” and must be reloaded or
reset in some way. It really only applies to effects where
this happens fairly often, as given in the Unreliable flaw
description. Large ammo or fuel capacities, which only
occasionally run out or inconvenience the character, are
better handled as descriptors and occasiona

It’s that simple. Note that, practically speaking, a major cir-
cumstance modifier effectively shifts a check up or down
a  degree  of  difficulty,  as  shown  on  the  Difficulty  Class
Examples  table.  Likewise,  a  major  modifier  effectively
changes the degree of a graded check by one (see Grad-
ed Checks in Chapter 1).

Routine checks reflect that some tasks and situations are
so  trivial  it  is  not  worth  having  a  player  roll  a  check.  It
would be illogical for the character to have a real chance
of failing at the task, since failure should be rare enough
to constitute a complication in that situation. Examples in-
clude things like a competent driver handling a car under
ordinary conditions or a trained professional performing
the routine tasks of a job.

Routine checks save time, because you do not need to ask
players  for  a  check  for  every  single  thing  their  characters
do, but they also provide valuable guidelines for when you
should ask the players for a check while running the game.
They  set  a  threshold  for  the  Difficulty  of  certain  actions.
When coming up with Difficulty Classes for your adventure,
keep the routine check rule in mind. If the DC is low enough
that anyone can succeed as a routine check, then it may be
too low, or the action may not be worth assigning a check.

Take Perception, for example. If you decide it is a DC 10
Perception  check  to  pick  up  on  some  clue  or  bit  of  in-
formation in the adventure, that Difficulty is low enough
that anyone with an unimpaired (0 or higher) Awareness
can succeed at the task as a routine check. Assuming the
information is also important to the plot, you might be
better off to simply tell the players their characters no-
tice  it  without  calling  for  a  check.  If  there  needs  to  be
a  chance  of  failure,  then  set  a  higher  Difficulty  for  the
check. Of course, If the situation is stressful—such as the
midst of combat—then a routine check is not an option,
and  a  lower  DC  can  provide  heroes  with  a  reasonably
high chance of success with just a small chance of failure
for dramatic purposes.

“TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENS...”

Sometimes  it’s  a  good  idea  to  make  checks  secretly,  so
the players don’t necessarily know the result. This is usu-
ally  the  case  for  any  sort  of  check  where  the  characters
don’t  immediately  know  whether  they’ve  succeeded  or
failed. For example, Perce

is one degree of success, just as a result of 8 is one degree
of failure.

There is no limit to the number of degrees a check may have,
although more than two degrees of failure rarely matters,
and some degrees of success may have no further effect be-
yond a certain point (once you have succeeded as well as
is possible in a given situation). For example, failure on an
Acrobatics check to balance means you wobble and spend
that  turn  maintaining  your  balance,  but  don’t  move. Two
degrees of failure mean you lose your balance and fall! After
that point, further degrees of failure don’t really matter.

In cases where a single degree of success or failure is suffi-
cient, the rules simply specify “success” or “failure” without
giving a degree.

Specific types of graded checks—notably skill and resis-
tance checks—give specific results for degrees of success
and failure in their descriptions.

Some circumstances make checks easier or harder, result-
ing in a bonus or penalty to the check. Characters in a fa-
vorable situation are said to have a circumstance bonus
for the check, while those in a disadvantageous situation
are said to be have a circumstance penalty.

As  a  general  rule,  apply  a  modifier  of  plus  or  minus  2  if
the character is at a minor bonus or minor penalty, and
a modifier of plus or minus 5 if the character is at a major
bonus or major penalty for the check:

Technically,  circumstance  modifiers  could  apply  to  ei-
ther the check result of the difficulty class of a check, af-
fecting the character’s performance, or making the task
itself  easier  or  harder.  If  you  want  to  differentiate  be-
tween circumstance modifiers that affect performance
versus those that modify the difficulty of a task, feel free
to  do  so.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  applies  circumstance
modifiers directly to the check result because it is easier
to deal with them consistently, and the game effect is
the same: the chance of success changes.

Circumstance  modifiers  are  another  useful  Gamemas-
ter  tool  for  handling  a  lot  of  the  variables  that  come
up  during  game  play.  Specific  examples  are  discussed
throughout  the  rules  for  various  types  of  checks.  One
example includes the following:
TOOLS

Some  tasks  require  tools.  If  tools  are  needed,  the  spe-
cific items are mentioned in the description of the task
or skill. If you don’t have the appropria

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

HIDING

OPERATING

If you have cover or concealment, make a Stealth check,
opposed by an observer’s Perception check, to hide and
go unnoticed.

If  others  are  aware  of  your  presence,  you  can’t  use
Stealth  to  remain  undetected.  You  can  run  around  a
corner so you are out of sight and then use Stealth, but
others know which way you went. You can’t hide at all if
you have absolutely no cover or concealment, since that
means you are standing out in plain sight. Of course, if
someone isn’t looking directly at you (you’re sneaking up
from behind, for example), then you have concealment
relative to that person.

A  successful  Deception  or  Intimidation  check  can  give
you the momentary distraction needed to make a Stealth
check  while  people  are  aware  of  you. When  others  turn
their attention from you, make a Stealth check if you can
reach  cover  or  concealment  of  some  kind.  (As  a  general
guideline, any such cover has to be within 1 foot for every
rank you have in Stealth.) This check, however, is at a –5
penalty because you have to move quickly.
TAILING

You  can  use  Stealth  to  tail  someone  at  your  normal
speed.  This  assumes  you  have  some  cover  or  conceal-
ment (crowds of people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject
is worried about being followed, he can make a Percep-
tion  check  (opposed  by  your  Stealth  check)  every  time
he  changes  course  (goes  around  a  street  corner,  exits  a
building,  and  so  on).  If  he  is  unsuspecting,  he  only  gets
one Perception check for the scene. If the subject notices
you, make a Deception check, opposed by Insight. If you
succeed, you manage to pass off your presence as coinci-
dence and can continue tailing. A failed Deception check,
or being noticed a second time, means the subject knows
something is up and reacts accordingly.

Most  routine  operations  of  technological  equipment
don’t require a skill check and can be done untrained. Us-
ing an unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC
determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from
simple (DC 10) to highly advanced (DC 25 or more).
BUILDING

The difficulty and time required to make an item depends
on its complexity, as shown on the Building Items table. If
your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item
after the necessary time. If the check fails, you did not pro-
duce a usable end result, and any time and materials are

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through
the ranks and now run the show. Physically a crime lord
is  no  match  for  a  hero,  but  their  connections,  resources,
and  knowledge  of  the  underworld  can  be  problematic.
The crime lord presented here is a fairly small fish; Game-
masters should make any changes needed to increase the
crime lord’s power and influence for the series.

*These numbers are for the Summoner only; for the Du-
plicator,  use  the  totals  listed  for  the  appropriate Twin  or
Triplets, then add the points for the Summon power.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

•

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

Supernatural Creatures are fantastical beings out of folk-
tales and scary stories. They’re generally regarded as ur-

The Totem is a superhero whose powers are closely tied to
a particular animal. The Totem may have acquired its pow-
ers  through  an  accident  of  science,  an  invocation  of  the
animal spirits, or may even be an exceptional, self-aware
animal. Totem heroes tend to be as varied as the animals
they represent, and they can resemble other archetypes
such as the Martial Artist, Warrior, and Powerhouse.
