CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Although some heroes and villains rely solely on their skills and advantages, most are set apart by their superhuman
powers. MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS characters can lift tanks, fly through the air, throw lightning from their hands, shoot lasers
from their eyes, or any number of other amazing things. This chapter describes these and many other powers and how
you can create your own.

Players spend power points on various powers for their heroes, like acquiring skills or other traits. A power is made up of
one or more effects, possibly with different modifiers, which increase or decrease the cost of the effects.

Effects can be used to create any number of different powers. A hero with the Concealment effect (see page 153) could use
it to create a power called Blending, Blur, Cloak, Invisibility, Shadowmeld, or anything else appropriate to the character you
wish to play. It’s all a matter of how powerful the effect is and what modifiers have been placed on it to increase or decrease
its performance. Another way to think of it is that this book is filled with effects, but your character sheet is filled with powers.

Power  effects  are  acquired  in  ranks,  like  ranks  for  other
traits. The more ranks an effect has, the greater its effect.
Each effect of a power has a standard cost per rank.

MODIFIERS

Modifiers  change  how  an  effect  works,  making  it  more
effective  (an  extra)  or  less  effective  (a  flaw).  Modifiers
have ranks, just like other traits. Extras increase a power’s
cost while flaws decrease it. Some modifiers increase an
effect’s cost per rank, others apply an unchanging cost to
the power’s total; these are called flat modifiers. For more
information see Modifiers, on page 187.

The  final  cost  of  a  power  is  determined  by  base  effect
costs,  modified  by  extras  and  flaws,  multiplied  by  the
power’s rank, with flat modifiers applied to the total cost.

Power Cost = ((base effect costs + extras -
flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers

The rules in this chapter explain what the various powers do,
that is, what their game effects are, but it is left up to the play-
er and Gamemaster to apply descriptors to define exactly
what a power is and what it looks (and sounds, and feels) like
to observers beyond just a collection of game effects.

A power’s descriptors are primarily for color. It’s more inter-
esting and clear to say a hero has a “Flame Blast” or “Light-
ning  Bolt”  power  than  a  gene

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

49

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

243

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

HOOD: SUPER-SHIELDS

Just as power armor is a device version of otherwise or-
dinary equipment armor, some heroes (and, less often,
villains) have shield devices providing them with great-
er benefits than an ordinary shield.

A shield device may provide Enhanced Dodge and Parry
defenses  like  a  mundane  shield,  or  it  can  grant  ranks
of  Protection  (which  do  stack  with  other  effects,  since
they’re not from equipment), perhaps even Impervious
Protection  for  a “bulletproof”  or “indestructible”  shield.
Such benefits are typically Sustained in duration, requir-
ing some action on the shield-wielder’s part.

A super-shield might even be useful as a weapon, pro-
viding a Damage effect, probably Strength-based. This is
best handled as an Alternate Effect of the shield, mean-
ing you can’t use it both offensively and defensively at
the same time! A hero able to hurl a shield at foes can
even have a Ranged Damage effect with it.

Chain-mail: A shirt of heavy metal chain, often with a coif
(hood) to cover the wearer’s head.

Plate-mail:  This  is  chain-mail  augmented  with  a  metal
breastplate, greaves (leg-guards) and arm-guards.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

EQUIPMENT

In addition to their amazing devices, characters often make use of various mundane equipment—ordinary things found
in the real world—ranging from a simple set of tools to cell phones, laptop computers, and even common appliances.
These items are known as equipment to differentiate them from devices.

EQUIPMENT

Equipment  is  acquired  with  points  from  the  Equipment
advantage. Each piece of equipment has a cost in points,
just  like  other  traits.  The  character  pays  the  item’s  cost
out of the points from the Equipment advantage and can
thereafter have and use that item.

An  item’s  cost  is  based  on  its  effects  and  features,  just
like a power (see the Powers chapter for more informa-
tion), so a ranged weapon has a cost based on its Ranged
Damage  rank.  Equipment  often  provides  the  Features
effect,  including  some  specific  equipment  Features  de-
scribed in this chapter. Indeed, some items of equipment
provide only Features.

Just as with power effects, there is a diminishing value in
having multiple items with a similar function, or a single
piece of equipment with multiple functions, usable only
one at a time. Equipment can have the Alternate Effect
modifier (see the Extras section of the Powers chapter),
such as a weapon capable of different modes of opera-
tion, or a reconfigurable tool.

Characters can also have Alternate Equipment, an array of
items usable only one at a time. This is typically a multi-
function  item,  or  a  kit  or  collection  of  various  smaller
items. The  classic  example  is  the  utility  belt  (see  its  de-
scription  later  in  this  chapter).  Alternate  Equipment  can
also  include  things  like  an  arsenal  of  weapons  the  char-
acter can swap out, providing different sets of weapons,
with only a limited number usable at once.

Characters may not necessarily carry all their equipment
with them at all times. The GM may allow players to spend
a hero point in order to have a particular item of equip-
ment “on-hand” at a particular time. This is essentially an
equipment  “power  stunt”—a  one-time  use  of  the  item
for  one  scene—and  the  Gamemaster  rules  whether  or
not having a particular item on-hand is even possible. For
example, a hero out for an evening in his secret identity
might have something like a concealed weapon or other
small item on-hand, but it’s unlikely the character is carry-

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

type  can  be  used  as  anything  from  an  archaeologist  to

Battlesuits  typically  fall  into  one  of  three  categories:
they’re either ranged combatants, melee powerhouses, or
a mix of the two. No matter what role the Battlesuit fills,
the  person  inside  the  armor  tends  to  be  a  fairly  normal
person, possibly highly trained or highly intelligent, who
relies on the armor to provide his or her powers.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

Example:  Makeshift  needs  to  whip  up  a  mind-
shielding  device  to  confront  Gepetto,  who  has
seized control of his teammates. Immunity to Mind
Control (a common Affliction effect) cost 5 power
points, so the Technology check is DC 15 (10 + 5)
and takes 5 hours. Makeshift’s skill bonus is +15, so
he succeeds automatically. The construction check
is  also  DC  15  (10  +  the  device’s  cost).  It  takes  20
hours. Makeshift again succeeds automatically on
the  check.  However,  that’s  25  hours  total  to  build
the  mind-shield,  and  Gepetto  plans  to  send  his
new “puppets” into action in just a few hours. Even
taking a –15 check penalty to cut the time to one-
eighth only takes it down to just over three hours.
Makeshift needs that device right now, so he’s go-
ing to need to speed things up....

you speed up the process any further by taking a check
penalty.  You  can  use  a  jury-rigged  invention  again  by
spending another hero point.

Example:  Needing  to  get  the  mind  shield  device
ready  right  away,  Makeshift’s  player  decides  to
spend a hero point to jury-rig it. He skips the design
step  altogether  and  reduces  construction  time  to
5 rounds (just under a minute). The DC of the con-
struction check increases to 20, but still well within
Makeshift’s skill; the player only needs to roll a 5 or
better. He rolls a 25 result on the check and, a min-
ute later, Makeshift has a makeshift mind-shield he
hopes will protect him from Gepetto’s power long
enough to try and free his teammates from the vil-
lain’s influence.

DEVICES

MISHAPS

An inventor can choose to spend a hero point to jury-rig a
device; ideal for when a particular device is needed right
now.  When  jury-rigging  a  device,  skip  the  design  check
and  reduce  the  time  of  the  construction  check  to  one
round  per  power  point  of  the  device’s  cost,  but  increase
the DC of the check by +5. The inventor makes the check
and, if successful, has use of the device for one scene be-
fore it burns out, falls apart, blows up, or otherwise fails.
You can’t jury-rig an invention as a routine check, nor can

At  the  GM’s  discretion,  three  or  more  degrees  of  failure,
or a natural roll of 1, on any required inventing skill check
may result in some unexpected side-effect or mishap. Ex-
actly  what  depends  heavily  on  the  invention.  Inventing

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

You can use combinations of advantages—particularly combat advantages—to create different “fighting styles” rang-
ing from martial arts to superhero combat techniques. For example, a “soft” fighting style focusing primarily on defense
might include the advantages Defensive Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Trip, and Instant Up. A “hard” fighting style
focused on offense might include All-out Attack, Improved Critical, Improved Smash, Power Attack, and Startle for a fierce
kiai shout! You can combine various advantages to create specific styles or allow players to mix-and-match to design their
own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet
mastered a style may have only some of a style’s associated advantages rather than all of them.

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

Startle.

Sword-fighting: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Taunt.

•  Wrestling: Chokehold, Fast Grab, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Power Attack.

Comic book martial artists often have abilities far beyond the scope of the advantages and fighting styles given in this
chapter. Such superhuman martial arts abilities as leaping vast distances, punching through solid stone, shrugging off
damage, and killing with a mere touch are powers. See the Powers chapter for details.

You can avoid damage through agility and “rolling” with
an  attack. You  receive  a  bonus  to  your Toughness  equal
to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active de-
fense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in
the  Abilities  chapter),  so  you  lose  this  bonus  whenever
you  are  vulnerable  or  defenseless. Your  total Toughness,
including this advantage, is still limited by power level.

Armor: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addi-
tion to its normal Toughness, possibly including Imper-
vious  Protection.  Some  vehicles  may  have  Sustained
Protection (such as force screens) instead of, or in addi-
tion to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.

Cloaking Device: A vehicle may have a “cloaking de-
vice” granting Concealment from visual senses. Some
vehicles  may  also  have  Concealment  from  auditory
senses or things such as radar, giving them a “stealth
mode.” 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense
type) or 8 points (all visual senses).

Immunity:  Vehicles  normally  provide
immunity
to  the  normal  hazards  of  environments  they  travel
through—such  as  underwater  or  in  space—at  no
additional  cost.  Additional  Immunity  effects  are  for
unusual hazards or circumstances, such as a car that
provides  a  sealed  air  system,  granting  immunity  to
suffocation and other atmospheric hazards.

Smokescreen:  The  vehicle  can  release  a  cloud  of
thick smoke or mist that provides an Area visual Con-
cealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pur-
suers. 12 points.

•  Weapons:  Vehicle  weapons  are  based  on  various
attack  effects,  particularly  Damage  with  various
modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may
mount versions of some of the weapons listed else-
where in this chapter.

A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole
team, particularly useful for shuttling around team mem-

bers  who  cannot  fly  or  move  at  super-speed. The  mem-
bers of the team divide the equipment point cost of the
vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the neces-
sary  ranks  of  the  Equipment  advantage  to  covering  the
vehicle’s cost.

Just like Alternate Equipment, characters may have mul-
tiple  vehicles. These  are  generally  Alternate  Equipment
by  definition,  since  it’s  difficult  to  drive  or  pilot  more
than one vehicle at a time! So the character pays the full
cost  for  the  most  expensive  vehicle,  and  then  1  equip-
ment point for each additional vehicle with the same or
lesser cost.

So a hero with an array of vehicles, such as a plane, boat,
and  car  pays  full  equipment  point  cost  for  the  most  ex-
pensive  of  the  vehicles  and  just  1  equipment  point  for
each  of  the  others.  The  hero’s  player  can  even  spend  a

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through

use of a tiring effect. In essence, the power requires extra
effort  in  order  to  use  it  (see  Extra  Effort,  page  19). This
makes Tiring a useful flaw for creating an effect you can
only use with extra effort.

Tiring is often applied to just some ranks of an effect to rep-
resent a higher level of the effect, usable only through extra
effort. For example, a hero might have a rank 12 Damage
effect, but routinely use only 8 ranks of it. The remaining
4 ranks are Tiring, so using them quickly fatigues the hero.

A Tiring effect can be combined with extra effort, but the
fatigue stacks, causing a minimum of two levels of fatigue
per use.

-1 COST PER RANK

You have no control over an effect with this flaw. Instead,
the Gamemaster decides when and how it works (essen-
tially  making  it  a  plot  device). This  flaw  is  best  suited  for
mysterious powers out of the characters’ direct control or
effects the GM feels more comfortable having under direct,
rather than player, control.

-1 COST PER RANK

An Unreliable effect doesn’t work all the time. Roll a die
each round before you use or maintain the effect. On a
10 or less, it doesn’t work this round, but you’ve still used
the action the effect requires. You can roll again on the
following  round  to  see  if  it  works,  although  you  must
take  the  normal  action  needed  to  activate  the  effect
again. Spending a hero point on your reliability roll al-

lows you to succeed automatically (since the roll is then
at least an 11).

Alternately,  instead  of  having  a  reliability  roll,  you  can
choose to have five uses where your effect works normal-
ly, then it stops working altogether until you can “recover”
it in some way (see the Fades flaw for more on this). The
GM may allow you to spend a hero point to automatically
recover a spent Unreliable power.

Powers  that  are  only  occasionally  unreliable  (less  than
about 50% of the time) are better handled as complica-
tions (see Complications, page 30).

One possible application of the Unreliable flaw is to re-
flect weapons or equipment that occasionally run out of
ammunition or “jam” or “crash” and must be reloaded or
reset in some way. It really only applies to effects where
this happens fairly often, as given in the Unreliable flaw
description. Large ammo or fuel capacities, which only
occasionally run out or inconvenience the character, are
better handled as descriptors and occasiona

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

215

A  common  piece  of  equipment  for  crime  fighters  and
espionage agents is the utility belt (or bag, pouch, back-
pack, etc.): a collection of useful tools and equipment in
a compact carrying case. A utility belt is an array of Alter-
nate Equipment. Some characters may have a Removable
array of devices instead, allowing for far more unusual ef-
fects than run-of-the-mill equipment.

Note  that  equipment  with  a  cost  of  1  equipment  point
doesn’t  really  need  to  be  acquired  as  Alternate  Equip-
ment,  since  there’s  no  change  in  cost.  Still,  heroes  often
have 1-point items in their utility belts, like flashlights, re-
breathers, and so forth.

By spending hero points you can temporarily add Alter-
nate  Equipment  to  your  utility  belt,  for  those  one-time
items you may need in a pinch.

Feel  free  to  modify  this  example  (adding  or  omitting
items)  to  create  your  own  customized  utility  belts. The
tear gas, as the most expensive effect, has full cost. The
other items cost 1 point each for Alternate Equipment,
making the total equipment point cost of the utility belt
25  equipment  points,  or  5  power  points  (for  5  ranks  of
the Equipment advantage).

For a flat 1-point reduction in the value of the Removable
flaw, you can define a device as Indestructible. It can still
be taken away, but cannot be damaged or destroyed, ex-
cept as a GM-imposed complication (earning the player a
hero point as usual). This reduction can lower the value of
the flaw to 0, in which case the character gets no power
point discount for the device.

The temporary loss of a removable power does not con-
stitute  a  complication,  any  more  than  the  result  of  any
other  flaw. You  can  have  a  device  or  power-object  as  a
descriptor without this flaw, if you wish, in which case the
power cannot be removed or taken away from you with-
out a complication applied by the GM (earning you a hero
point) or the use of an effect like Nullify, which has pre-
defined conditions for recovery.

-1 COST PER RANK

When applied to an effect that doesn’t normally allow a
resistance  check,  this  flaw  gives  it  one.  Choose  the  de-
fense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on
others  allow  a  resistance  check  by  definition,  this  nearly
always applies to personal effects that allow someone in-
teracting with them to circumvent the effect with a suc-
cessful check.

For  example,  an  Enhanced  Parry  defense  effect  might  re-
flect a low-level reading of a target’s mind to anticipate and
avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome
the effect, denying you the defense bonus against that op-
ponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your
Concealment  effect  might  be  illusory  rather  than  a  true
physical transformation, permitting a Will resistance check
for someone to overcome it. A sustained Protection effect
might be some sort of “kinetic field” that permits an attack-
er a Fortitude resistance check to overcome it.

When applied to an effect that does normally allow a re-
sistance check, this flaw gives it an additional one, which
may be the same as its normal

the headquarters. As such, they shouldn’t be considered
all-purpose Minions of the occupant(s). A base’s person-
nel may help defend it in case of attack, but they’re not
going to go out on missions or otherwise assist outside
of their duties. This feature simply ensures there’s some-
one  taking  care  of  the  place  while  the  owner  isn’t  at
home.

Note that an HQ’s personnel do not have to be ordinary
humans.  They  could  be  service  robots,  magical  golems,
animated skeletons, enslaved aliens, trained apes, or just
about anything else the GM chooses to fit with the theme
of the base and its owner(s).

A  power  system  makes  the  headquarters  completely
independent  of  outside  power.  It  has  its  own  genera-
tors  (which  may  be  solar,  geothermal,  nuclear,  cosmic,
or  anything  else  the  designer  wants). They  provide  the
base’s  entire  power  needs.  The  headquarters  also  has
emergency  back-up  power  should  the  generators  fail.
This  generally  lasts  for  a  number  of  hours  equal  to  the
HQ’s power level.

SEALED

This  is  similar  to  the  Isolated  feature,  except  the  lair  is
sealed off from the outside world rather than isolated by
geographic location. It may be a structure with no doors,
windows,  or  other  outside  access,  or  behind  some  sort
of  barrier.  Only  the  lair’s  owner  and  designated  guests
may enter, although the GM should determine means by
which  trespassers  might  do  so,  including  effects  like  Di-
mensional Travel, Insubstantial, Permeate, and Teleport.

SECRET

does. If this feature is taken twice, the structure will even
rebuild itself in a week if it is destroyed! If it cannot rebuild
in its original location, it reappears in the nearest suitable
place.

Time within the headquarters actually moves at a differ-
ent  rate  than  that  of  the  world  outside! Time  within  the
structure is either slowed or sped up compared to the nor-
mal passage of time, passing at half or twice the normal
rate.  Each  additional  application  of  this  feature  doubles
the ratio of time passage: one-quarter or four times, one-
eighth or eight times, and so forth.

This  time  differential  allows  a  character  within  an  accel-
erated  Temporal  Limbo  to  spend  additional  time  plan-
ning, building, or recovering while little or no time passes
outside,  for  example.  Conversely,  it  allows  characters  in

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

•

•

Divine powers come from a higher being, essentially
a  god  or  gods.  Divine  power  is  generally  limited  to
the  god(s)  areas  of  influence  and  may  be  morally
aligned, available only to wielders with an allegiance
to that divinity.

Extradimensional  powers  originate  outside  the
home  dimension  of  the  setting,  from  other  planes
or dimensions of existence. Some extradimensional
powers  are  scientific  while  others  are  downright
mystical,  or  even  beyond  into  realms “man  was  not
meant to know.”

•

•

•  Magical powers draw upon magical energies, how-
ever they might be defined in the setting. Typically,
there  is  some  sort  of “magical  energy”  in  existence
that magicians and magical creatures draw upon for
their  powers  and  effects.  Note  that  powers  with  a
magical source are not necessarily “spells,” although
they might be; a dragon’s breath might use magic to
power it, or it might be biological, depending on the
descriptors applied to it (in other words, how it’s de-
fined in terms of the setting).

•  Moral  powers  come  from  an  abstract  morality  or
ideal,  essentially  from  an  allegiance  to  that  ideal.
Whether or not the moral power is aware and capa-
ble of interaction is up to the GM and the specifica-
tions of the setting; it’s the character’s belief in that
ideal that matters so far as the power is concerned.
“Good” and “evil” are common abstract moral sourc-
es of powers, but others may include chaos, law, an-
archy, order, justice, balance, neutrality, reason, and
so forth.

Psionic powers are powers of the mind, coming from
the psyche of the wielder (or perhaps from the Col-
lective  Unconscious,  which  acts  as  a “wellspring”  of
psionic power). This power source is associated with
classic “mental” powers like telepathy and telekinesis,
although effects like Mind Reading and Move Object
can also come from other sources.

Technological powers are the result of technology,
machines and technological devices. Although tech-
nological  power  sources  often  involve  Devices  or
Equipment, they don’t necessary have to; a techno-
logical  power  may  be  a  permanent  implant,  for  ex-
ample,  without  the  limitations  of  a  Device,  but  still
technological  (and  affected  by  things  keyed  to  the
technological descriptor).

MEDIUM

A power’s medium is what the power uses to accomplish its
effect(s). Often, a power’s source and me

mankind, he or she may also become a hero for the
same reason.

•  Motivation—Recognition:  Some  Gadgeteers  want
their genius recognized not just by other  scientists,
but by millions of adoring fans.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Gadgeteer  often
feels it’s only right to use his or her incredible intel-
ligence to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Gadgeteers  love  to  push  the
limit and live on the edge of scientific research, so it
only makes sense that they might like dressing up in
tights and taking on the role of a hero.

•

•

Quirk—Psychological Problems: Perhaps the Gad-
geteer’s  devices  have  slowly  been  poisoning  his
or  her  mind,  or  biofeedback  caused  by  improperly
functioning cybernetics or other mechanical systems
have  caused  the  Gadgeteer  to  exhibit  some  sort  of
mental problem.

Relationship:  Gadgeteers  often  have  a  number  of
important  people  in  their  life,  either  family,  loved
ones, other researchers, or employees who like to get
into trouble.

The Martial Artist has honed his skills in unarmed combat
to  bridge  the  physical  gap  between  him  and  his  super-
powered  associates.  In  fact,  some  Martial  Artists  display
feats  that  seem  impossible  by  normal  standards—and
may have a mystical origin.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR
CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

From blaster rifles to anti-gravity belts, teleportation rings, and battlesuits, heroes and villains develop all manner of gad-
gets. Villains are forever coming up with doomsday machines and fiendish deathtraps while heroes use all sorts of gear
to aid them in their fight for justice. This chapter looks at various sorts of devices and equipment in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS
game terms. It also describes vehicles, headquarters, and constructs, ranging from zombie minions to giant robots.

DEVICES

A device is an item that provides a particular power effect or set of effects. While devices are typically creations of ad-
vanced science, they don’t have to be. Many heroes and villains have magical devices such as enchanted weapons and
armor, magical talismans, wands and staves of power, and so forth. Some devices are products of alien technology so
advanced they might as well be magical, or focuses of psychic or cosmic power beyond the understanding of both
magic and science. All devices work the same way in game terms, regardless of their origin or descriptors.

Generally speaking, devices are powers with the Removable flaw applied to them (see Removable in the Powers chapter),
meaning the power is external to the character. Take away the device, and the wielder loses the ability to use those powers.
So if an armored hero loses access to his battlesuit, for example, he also loses access to the powers tied-up in it. The same
is the case of a hero loses a cosmic ring, magic helmet, or alien artifact, which is why Removable is a flaw for those powers.

Just like other powers, devices cost power points (albeit reduced some by the Removable flaw). Characters who want to
have and use a device on a regular basis have to pay power points to have it, just like having any other power. The device
becomes a part of the character’s abilities. If the device is lost, stolen, or destroyed, the character can replace it, given
time, since the device is considered a permanent part of the character. Only a re-allocation of the character’s power
points will change this, and Gamemasters should allow characters to re-allocate power points spent on a Removable
power if it is somehow permanently lost.

In other cases, characters may make temporary use of a device. Most devices are usable by anyone able to operate
them, in which case characters may loan devices to each other, or may pick up and use someone else’s device (or even
steal a

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Lady  Liberty,  rescuing  people  from  a
tenement  fire,  is  hemmed-in  by  collapsed  debris.
Her player decides to simply punch a path through.
Since  she’s  going  for  maximum  damage,  she  de-
cides  to  make  the  attack  check  normally  (rather
than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she’ll
only miss on a natural 1 anyway. She succeeds and
does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic
critical. The GM decides the brick, mortar, and heavy
beams have a toughness of 9 and makes a Tough-
ness  check,  rolling  a  5,  against  a  DC  30  (Lady  Lib-
erty’s Damage +15). A 14 result is three degrees of
failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and
clears the building, carrying people to safety!

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

Living targets remove one damage condition per minute
of  rest,  starting  from  their  worst  condition  and  working
back. So a damaged character recovers from being inca-
pacitated, then staggered, dazed, and finally removes a –1
Toughness check penalty per minute until fully recovered.
The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications  (see  Lasting Injuries  in  the  Recovery section
of the Action & Adventure chapter).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

self as well as other psychics.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  Some  Psychics  use
their powers for good, because they feel they must
have been given their powers to help others.

•

•

Power  Loss:  Because  mental  powers  often  require
some  amount  of  focus;  drugs,  disorientation  of  any
kind, or noisy settings may prevent a Psychic from us-
ing his or her powers.

Quirk—Impressionable:  Psychic’s  with  telepathy
may  pick  up  personality  traits  and  attitudes  from
people they’ve interacted with using their powers.

Shapeshifters include characters who actually change their
shape to become animals, machines, mythic creatures, or hu-
manoid monsters, as well as characters who can change their

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: An artificial intelligence or
magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-
sessed Construct may recall enough of its former life
to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Construct may feel
that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

•

•

Enemy:  The  Construct  could  be  a  rogue  android,
golem,  or  summoned  elemental  hunted  by  its
creator(s)  or  another  person  or  group  who  believes

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR
CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

The headquarters is equipped with an automatic system
for  detecting  and  extinguishing  fires.  Any  large  open
flame  sets  the  system  off  (beware,  fire-using  heroes!).  It
functions as a Nullify Fire 5 effect. A computer-controlled
fire prevention system can be programmed to ignore cer-
tain sources of fire or the system can be placed on manual
control (requiring someone to throw a switch in order to
activate it).

GARAGE

A garage houses ground vehicles and includes a ramp, el-
evator, or other access to move vehicles in and out, facili-
ties for repairing and maintaining vehicles, and a sliding
access door.
GROUNDS

In addition to the actual building(s) of the headquarters, it
has a considerable area of land surrounding it. An HQ can
have  surrounding  land  of  one  size  category  larger  than
the structure at no cost, without having this feature. Hav-
ing it allows for grounds up to three size categories larger
than the structure, so a large mansion headquarters could
have a colossal area of land.

If the headquarters has features like Defense System and
Security System, they also extend over the grounds (with
fences, sensors, weapon emplacements, and so forth).

GYM

A  gym  consists  of  weight-training  and  other  exercise
machines,  space  for  working  out,  stretching,  and  similar
exercises, and all the necessary amenities (lockers, show-
ers, etc.). Some HQs may incorporate the gym feature into
the combat simulator, for a multi-purpose training room.
A gym may also include a pool (heated or unheated, good
for  aquatic  characters),  possibly  even  connected  to  an
outside  body  of  water,  to  the  base’s  dock,  or  both  at  no
additional cost.

HANGAR

A hangar houses air and space vehicles. It includes a hatch
and/or runway for the vehicles to launch and facilities for
repairing and maintaining flying vehicles. For some HQs
the launch facilities of the hangar may require a long tun-
nel or other access to the outside.

These are cells for holding prisoners, usually temporarily,
although  some  headquarters  might  have  more  perma-
nent holding facilities. The cells are equipped with Nul-
lify devices (ranked at the HQ power level) or their basic
Toughness is increased by 50%, which option should be
agreed  upon  by  both  player  and  GM  (both  options  for
two  features).  Heroes  use  holding  cells  to  contain  cap-
tured villains until th

and how it is used.

Agility • Trained Only

Use Acrobatics to flip, dive, roll, tumble, and perform other
acrobatic maneuvers, as well as keeping your balance un-
der difficult circumstances.
BALANCING

You  can  keep  your  balance  and  move  along  a  precari-
ous  surface  at  your  ground  speed  minus  1  rank  with  a
successful  Acrobatics  check  against  the  surface’s  DC.  A
degree of failure indicates you spend your move action
just maintaining your balance and do not actually move,
while  two  or  more  degrees  of  failure  means  you  lose
your balance and fall.

word, “Energy,” or “Energy Control type,” above.

An  Energy  Controller’s  personality  often  reflect  the

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

type  can  be  used  as  anything  from  an  archaeologist  to
zoologist, or for anything with a lot of knowledge about a
particular subject, such as a professor.

Battlesuits  typically  fall  into  one  of  three  categories:
they’re either ranged combatants, melee powerhouses, or
a mix of the two. No matter what role the Battlesuit fills,
the  person  inside  the  armor  tends  to  be  a  fairly  normal
person, possibly highly trained or highly intelligent, who
relies on the armor to provide his or her powers.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

107

Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.

STRENGTH (STR)

INTELLECT (INT)

Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to
apply it. Your Strength rank applies to:

•

Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based
attacks.
How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).
The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.
Athletics skill checks.

•
•
•
STAMINA (STA)

Stamina  is  health,  endurance,  and  overall  physical  resil-
ience.  Stamina  is  important  because  it  affects  a  charac-
ter’s ability to resist most forms of damage. Your Stamina
modifier applies to:

•
•

•

Toughness defense, for resisting damage.
Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your
character’s health.
Stamina  checks  to  resist  or  recover  from  things  af-
fecting  your  character’s  health  when  a  specific  de-
fense doesn’t apply.

AGILITY (AGL)

Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coor-
dination. Your Agility rank applies to:

•

•
•
•

Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and oth-
er hazards.
Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.
Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.
Agility  checks  for  feats  of  coordination,  gross  move-
ment, and quickness when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

DEXTERITY (DEX)

Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  hand-eye  coordination,  preci-
sion, and manual dexterity. Your Dexterity rank applies to:

•
•
•

Attack checks for ranged attacks.
Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.
Dexterity  checks  for  feats  of  fine  control  and  preci-
sion when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

FIGHTING (FGT)

Fighting  measures  your  character’s  ability  in  close  com-
bat, from hitting a target to ducking and weaving around
any counter-attacks. Your Fighting rank applies to:

•
•

Attack checks for close attacks.
Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.

Intellect covers reasoning ability and learning. A character
with a high Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and
well-educated. Your Intellect modifier applies to:

•

•

Expertise,  Investigation, Technology,  and Treatment
skill checks.
Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-
power when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

AWARENESS (AWE)

While  Intellect  covers  reasoning,  Awareness  describes
common sense and intuition, what some might call “wis-
dom.” A character with a high Intellect and a low Aware-
ness may be an “absent-minded professor” type, smart

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

211

Example:  Makeshift  needs  to  whip  up  a  mind-
shielding  device  to  confront  Gepetto,  who  has
seized control of his teammates. Immunity to Mind
Control (a common Affliction effect) cost 5 power
points, so the Technology check is DC 15 (10 + 5)
and takes 5 hours. Makeshift’s skill bonus is +15, so
he succeeds automatically. The construction check
is  also  DC  15  (10  +  the  device’s  cost).  It  takes  20
hours. Makeshift again succeeds automatically on
the  check.  However,  that’s  25  hours  total  to  build
the  mind-shield,  and  Gepetto  plans  to  send  his
new “puppets” into action in just a few hours. Even
taking a –15 check penalty to cut the time to one-
eighth only takes it down to just over three hours.
Makeshift needs that device right now, so he’s go-
ing to need to speed things up....

you speed up the process any further by taking a check
penalty.  You  can  use  a  jury-rigged  invention  again  by
spending another hero point.

Example:  Needing  to  get  the  mind  shield  device
ready  right  away,  Makeshift’s  player  decides  to
spend a hero point to jury-rig it. He skips the design
step  altogether  and  reduces  construction  time  to
5 rounds (just under a minute). The DC of the con-
struction check increases to 20, but still well within
Makeshift’s skill; the player only needs to roll a 5 or
better. He rolls a 25 result on the check and, a min-
ute later, Makeshift has a makeshift mind-shield he
hopes will protect him from Gepetto’s power long
enough to try and free his teammates from the vil-
lain’s influence.

DEVICES

MISHAPS

An inventor can choose to spend a hero point to jury-rig a
device; ideal for when a particular device is needed right
now.  When  jury-rigging  a  device,  skip  the  design  check
and  reduce  the  time  of  the  construction  check  to  one
round  per  power  point  of  the  device’s  cost,  but  increase
the DC of the check by +5. The inventor makes the check
and, if successful, has use of the device for one scene be-
fore it burns out, falls apart, blows up, or otherwise fails.
You can’t jury-rig an invention as a routine check, nor can

At  the  GM’s  discretion,  three  or  more  degrees  of  failure,
or a natural roll of 1, on any required inventing skill check
may result in some unexpected side-effect or mishap. Ex-

move  one  of  the  following  conditions  from  an  ally  with
whom you can interact: dazed, fatigued, or stunned.

LUCK

FORTUNE, RANKED (1/2 PL)

Once per round, you can choose to re-roll a die roll, like
spending a hero point (see Hero Points, page 20), includ-
ing adding 10 to re-rolls of 10 or less. You can do this a
number  of  times  per  game  session  equal  to  your  Luck
rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level
(rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero
points “reset”  at  the  start  of  an  adventure. The  GM  may
choose to set a different limit on ranks in this advantage,
depending on the series.

Generally speaking, languages are not terribly important
in comic book superhero stories except as background col-
or or occasional plot complications. Gamemasters should
allow  players  with  characters  fluent  in  other  languages
the occasional opportunity to show them off or put them
to good use. If you specifically set up the language barrier
as an obstacle by confronting the heroes with a language
they cannot possibly understand, that should count as a
complication and be worth a hero point.

COMBAT

MINION

GENERAL, RANKED

You can draw a weapon from a holster or sheath as a free
action, rather than a move action.

You have a follower or minion. This minion is an indepen-
dent  character  with  a  power  point  total  of  (advantage
rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level
limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions
(if capable of independent thought) automatically have a
helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the nor-
mal rules for minions (see page 245).

Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend
earned  power  points  to  increase  your  rank  in  this  advan-
tage to improve the minion’s power point total and traits.
Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are
replaced in between adventures with other followers with
similar abilities at the Gamemaster’s discretion.

ACTION

COMBAT

When taking a standard action and a move action you can
move both before and after your standard action, provid-
ed the total distance moved isn’t greater than your normal
movement speed.

COMBAT

When  you  make  a  power  attack  (see  Maneuvers,  page
250)  you  can  take  a  penalty  of  up  to  –5  on  your  attack
bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to the effect
bonus of your attack.

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

You can use combinations of advantages—particularly combat advantages—to create different “fighting styles” rang-
ing from martial arts to superhero combat techniques. For example, a “soft” fighting style focusing primarily on defense
might include the advantages Defensive Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Trip, and Instant Up. A “hard” fighting style
focused on offense might include All-out Attack, Improved Critical, Improved Smash, Power Attack, and Startle for a fierce
kiai shout! You can combine various advantages to create specific styles or allow players to mix-and-match to design their
own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet
mastered a style may have only some of a style’s associated advantages rather than all of them.

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

Kung Fu: Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Improved Smash, Improved Trip, Instant Up, Power Attack,
Startle.

Sword-fighting: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Taunt.

•  Wrestling: Chokehold, Fast Grab, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Power Attack.

Comic book martial artists often have abilities far beyond the scope of the advantages and fighting styles given in this
chapter. Such superhuman martial arts abilities as leaping vast distances, punching through solid stone, shrugging off
damage, and killing with a mere touch are powers. See the Powers chapter for details.

You can avoid damage through agility and “rolling” with
an  attack. You  receive  a  bonus  to  your Toughness  equal
to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active de-
fense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in
the  Abilities  chapter),  so  you  lose  this  bonus  whenever
you  are  vulnerable  or  defenseless. Your  total Toughness,
including this advantage, is still limited by power level.

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

The  bonus  from  a  Close  Combat  skill  applies  only  to  at-
tack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses. For
a broader bonus to attack checks that is less than simply
raising  Fighting  rank,  see  the  Close  Attack  advantage  in
the Advantages chapter.

DECEPTION

Presence • Interaction

Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you
want them to believe. It covers things like acting, bluffing,
fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.

Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story.
Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move
action by taking a –5 penalty to your check.

BLUFFING

Make  a  Deception  check  to  tell  a  believable  lie  or  get
someone do go along with you.

A  bluff  is  usually  opposed  by  the  target’s  Deception  or
Insight  check.  Favorable  and  unfavorable  circumstances
weigh  heavily  on  the  outcome.  Two  circumstances  can
work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what
you  ask  goes  against  the  target’s  self-interest,  nature,  or
personality.

If it’s important, you can distinguish between a deception
that  fails  because  the  target  doesn’t  believe  it  and  one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the tar-
get gets a +10 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands serious risk, and the resistance check succeeds
by 10 or less, then the target doesn’t so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the
target’s Insight check succeeds by 11 or more, he has seen
through  the  deception,  and  would  have  refused  even  if
it had not placed unusual demands on him (that is, even
without the +10 modifier).

MODIFIER

The target wants
to believe you.

The deception is believable
and doesn’t affect the target
much either way.

The deception is a little hard
to believe or puts the target at
some kind of risk.

The deception is difficult
to believe or entails
a serious risk.

The deception is way
out there, almost too
incredible to consider.

There are a number of factors to consider when choosing skills for your MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS character.

VS. TALENT

In game terms there’s no difference between a character who has ranks in a skill because of extensive training and an-
other whose skill ranks represent a natural talent or aptitude for the skill. Both are considered “trained” in the skill in

though you can move (move action) and then attack (stan-
dard  action)  or  attack  and  then  move,  you  cannot  move
half  your  distance,  attack,  and  then  move  the  other  half
unless you have some special trait that allows you to do so.

At the end of your turn, you should:

•

End any effects that last “until the end of your turn”.

•  Make  any  necessary  resistance  checks  to  recover

You  can  use  extra  effort  in  order  to  take  an  additional
standard or move action on your turn (see Extra Effort on
page 19).

•

from ongoing effects.

Inform the Gamemaster and other players that your
turn is finished, allowing the next character in the ini-
tiative order to go.

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game terms, a challenge is an action or series of actions where players are called upon to make
checks of their characters’ traits, but which do not involve direct conflict, such as fighting. Some challenges are quick
and involve only a single character, such as a hero making a daring leap or acrobatic maneuver, while others are more
involved and require the efforts of a whole team, such as clearing all of the people out of a burning building or search-
ing the entire city (or world!) for an escaped criminal.

The challenges given in this section are by no means the only possible ones. They simply cover the major “building
blocks” Gamemasters can use to create challenges in their own games and offer examples. Feel free to come up with
your own challenges to test the heroes’ abilities and give the players an opportunity to come up with clever plans of
their own.

Challenges may or may not involve initiative checks, de-
pending on the nature of the challenge.

If all of the characters get a turn and it does not particu-
larly matter who goes first, then the Gamemaster can dis-
pense with initiative for the challenge. For example, if the
heroes  all  have  to  leap  across  a  chasm,  then  it  is  a  chal-
lenge they must all complete, and it does not particularly
matter which of them goes first or last in doing so (since
their actions are all virtually simultaneous).

With other challenges, it does matter who goes first, par-
ticular when the challenge is timed in some fashion. So,
for example, if the GM determines that part of a burning
building will collapse after the first round, initiative may
be  checked  to  see  which  heroes  go  before  the  collapse

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  broken  down  into
sense types, used as descriptors for sensory effects. Here
are  the  traits  of  normal  human  senses,  for  use  when
modifying them with the options from Senses:

VISUAL

Normal  vision  is  ranged  (with  a  –1/10  feet  modifier),
acute (able to distinguish fine details) and accurate (able
to pinpoint the locations of things).
AUDITORY

Normal hearing is ranged  (with  a –1/10  feet modifier),
acute  (able  to  pick  up  details  like  differences  in  tone),
and radius (able to pick up on sounds coming from any
direction). Normal hearing is not accurate.

OLFACTORY

Normal  human  olfactory  senses,  which  lump  together
smell  and  taste  for  descriptor  purposes,  are  fairly  lim-
ited. Ordinary human olfactory senses are neither acute
nor accurate. The sense of smell is a radius sense, how-
ever, able to pick up on scents coming from any direc-
tion. Its “range” is quite limited, however, effectively only
close, except for especially strong scents.

TACTILE

The normal sense of touch is, by definition, close range.
It is accurate (in that you know the location of anything
you  can  touch)  and  radius  (in  that  you  can  feel  things
from any surface of your body).

MENTAL

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS terms, the “sixth sense” or men-
tal  sense  type  is  fairly  crude  in  normal  humans,  lim-
ited essentially to interactions with the Insight skill and
awareness of mental effects used directly on you. Thus it
is close range and has none of the Sense qualities.

horizon and physical barriers between you and the sub-
ject, unless it also Penetrates Concealment.

1 RANK

You can see in the infrared portion of the spectrum, allow-
ing you to see heat patterns. Darkness does not provide
concealment  for  objects  differing  in  temperature  from
their  surroundings.  If  you  have  the Track  effect,  you  can
track warm creatures by the faint heat trails they leave be-
hind. The Gamemaster is the final judge on how long the
trail remains visible.
VISION

1 RANK

You can view extremely small things. You can make Per-
ception checks to see tiny things nearby. Cost is 1 rank for
dust-sized  objects,  2  ranks  for  cellular-sized,  3  ranks  for
DNA and complex molecules, 4 ranks for atomic-sized. The
GM  may  require  an  Expertise  skill  check  to  understand
and interpret what you see.

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through
the ranks and now run the show. Physically a crime lord
is  no  match  for  a  hero,  but  their  connections,  resources,
and  knowledge  of  the  underworld  can  be  problematic.
The crime lord presented here is a fairly small fish; Game-

crime lord’s power and influence for the series.

Some  checks  are  opposed.  They  are  made  against  an-
other character’s check result as the DC. Whoever gets the
higher result wins. An example is trying to bluff someone.
You roll a Deception check, while the GM rolls an Insight
check for your target. If you beat the target’s Insight check
result, you succeed.

For ties on opposed checks, the character with the higher
bonus  wins.  If  the  bonuses  are  the  same,  roll  d20.  On  a
1–10, one character wins, and on an 11–20, victory goes to
the other character; decide which character is “high” and
which is “low” before rolling.

Opposed checks offer the Gamemaster a useful tool for
comparing the efforts of two characters quickly and eas-
ily. This applies not only to skills, but also powers and, in
some cases, abilities. If two or more characters compete
at a particular task, you can resolve it with an opposed
check. The character with the highest check result wins.
Of  course,  you  can  play  things  out  if  you  want,  but
sometimes it’s good to be able to resolve things with a
quick opposed check and move on.

As Gamemaster, if you find yourself without a particular
rule to resolve a conflict or contest between characters,
the opposed check is your friend. Pick the appropriate
skill,  power,  or  ability,  make  checks  for  the  characters
and compare the results to see how they did.

opposing character’s modifier +10, just like the result of
a routine check (previously).

Active defenses in combat, where characters are focusing
on other actions, are generally routine opposition, which
is why attack checks are made against a DC of 10 + the ap-
propriate defense. Active opposed checks in combat are
an  option  when  a  character  goes  on  the  defensive.  See
Defend in the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

In cases where a check is a simple test of one character’s
capability  against  another,  with  no

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  Some  Psychics  use
their powers for good, because they feel they must
have been given their powers to help others.

Power  Loss:  Because  mental  powers  often  require
some  amount  of  focus;  drugs,  disorientation  of  any

people they’ve interacted with using their powers.

Shapeshifters include characters who actually change their
shape to become animals, machines, mythic creatures, or hu-

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS Roleplaying Game allows you to create any sort of hero you want by choosing your character’s
abilities, skills, powers, and other traits. You have a “budget” of power points with which to build your hero. There are
also certain limits and guidelines imposed by the game’s power level, chosen by the Gamemaster, but within those
limits you can build a wide range of characters.

The quickest and easiest way to create your own MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero is to look through the various hero arche-
types on pages 35-49, choose one that fits the type of hero you want to play, and customize it to match your ideas. With
just a few quick choices, you have a new hero, complete and ready for the game!

Each archetype offers a complete, ready-to-play power level 10 hero, the recommended starting power level for MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS. Some archetypes offer a few simple choices in terms of skills, advantages, or sets of powers to fit different
themes. For example, many archetypes offer a choice of an Expertise skill to round out the character’s background and
interests outside of superheroism.

Some archetypes also offer an Options section, where you can change some of the pre-existing trait choices to create a
different kind of hero. For example, the Crime Fighter archetype has options for a hero with less equipment, but super-
human senses, or a special vehicle of some type. Other archetypes offer similar options.

Even if the archetype does not have an Options section that does not mean you cannot customize the archetype to suit
the type of hero you want to play! The archetypes are just starting points: if you are more familiar with character design
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, feel free to change any or all of your chosen archetype’s traits. So long as you stay within the
bounds of available power points, series power level, and your Gamemaster’s approval, you’re fine.

Please note, the characters on pages 35-49 include some Advantages in italicized print. Those advantages are from an
Enhanced Advantage effect listed in their powers.

Designing a hero from scratch in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS follows a series of simple steps, using the information presented
in the other chapters of this book. You’ll need a copy of the character sheet found in the back of the book (and also avail-
able online) and some scratch paper to design your character. If you’re pressed for time, looking for some inspiration,

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

Heroes are more than just skilled, they often have amazing advantages, beyond the abilities of ordinary people. In MU-
MASTERMINDS, advantages often allow heroes to “break the rules,” gaining access to and doing things most people
cannot, or simply doing them better.

Advantages are rated in ranks and bought with power points, just like abilities and skills. Advantages cost 1 power point
per rank. Some advantages have no ranks and are acquired only once, effectively at rank 1.
Advantage Cost = 1 power point per advantage rank

Each advantage’s description explains the benefit it provides. It also says if the advantage can be acquired in ranks and
the effects of doing so. Such advantages are listed as “Ranked” alongside the advantage name. Ranks in a advantage are
noted with a number after the advantage’s name, such as “Defensive Roll 2” (for a character who has taken two ranks
in the Defensive Roll advantage), just like skill and power ranks. If there is a maximum number of ranks a character can
take, it’s listed in parentheses after the word “Ranked” in the advantage’s heading.

Advantages are categorized as one of four types:

•

•

•

•

Combat  Advantages  are  useful  in  combat  and  of-
ten modify how various combat maneuvers are per-
formed.

Fortune  Advantages  require  and  enhance  the  use
of hero points.

General Advantages provide special abilities or bo-
nuses not covered by the other categories.

Skill Advantages offer bonuses or modifications to
skill use.

Each advantage is listed by name, type, and if the advan-
tage is available in multiple ranks, followed by a descrip-
tion of the advantage’s benefits. The effects of additional
ranks  of  the  advantage  (if  any)  are  noted  in  the  text  of
each advantage. In some cases a advantage’s description
mentions  the  normal  conditions  for  characters  who  do
not have the advantage for comparison.

COMBAT

When you make an accurate attack (see Maneuvers, page
249) you can take a penalty of up to –5 on the effect modi-
fier of the attack and add the same number (up to +5) to
your attack bonus.

SKILL

You can use your Acrobatics bonus or movement speed
rank in place of Deception to feint and trick in combat as if
your skill bonus or speed rank were your Deception bonus
(see the Deception skill description). Your opponent op-
poses the attempt with Acrobatics or Insight (whichever
is better).

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

FASCINATE

SKILL, RANKED

COMBAT

One of your interaction skills is so effective you can cap-
ture  and  hold  other’s  attention  with  it.  Choose  Decep-
tion,  Intimidation,  or  Persuasion  when  you  acquire  this
advantage. You can also use Fascinate with an appropri-
ate  Expertise  skill,  like  musician  or  singer,  at  the  GM’s
discretion.

You  are  subject  to  the  normal  guidelines  for  interaction
skills, and combat or other immediate danger makes this
advantage  ineffective. Take  a  standard  action  and  make
an  interaction  skill  check  against  your  target’s  opposing
check (Insight or Will defense). If you succeed, the target is
entranced. You can maintain the effect with a standard ac-
tion each round, giving the target a new resistance check.
The effect ends when you stop performing, the target suc-
cessfully resists, or any immediate danger presents itself.
Like all interaction skills, you can use Fascinate on a group,
but  you  must  affect  everyone  in  the  group  in  the  same
way.

You may take this advantage more than once. Each time, it
applies to a different skill.

FAST GRAB

COMBAT

When  you  hit  with  an  unarmed  attack  you  can  immedi-
ately make a grab check against that opponent as a free
action (see Grab, page 248). Your unarmed attack inflicts
its normal damage and counts as the initial attack check
required to grab your opponent.

COMBAT

You  have  an  environment  you’re  especially  suited  for
fighting  in.  Examples  include  in  the  air,  underwater,  in
space, in extreme heat or cold, in jungles or woodlands,
and so forth. While you are in your favored environment,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack checks or your
active defenses. Choose at the start of the round whether
the bonus applies to attack or defense. The choice remains
until the start of your next round. This circumstance bonus
is not affected by power level.

SKILL

You have a particular type of opponent you’ve studied or
are especially effective against. It may be a type of creature
(aliens, animals, constructs, mutants, undead, etc.), a pro-
fession (soldiers, police officers, Yakuza, etc.) or any other
category  the  GM  approves.  Especially  broad  categories
like “humans” or “villains” are not permitted. You gain a +2
circumstance  bonus  on  Deception,  Intimidation,  Insight,
and Perception checks dealing with your Favored Foe. This
circumstance bonus is not limited by power level.

•

Indirect  4:  The  effect  can  originate  from  any  point
and aim in any direction, including towards you
(hitting a target in front of you from behind, for ex-
ample).

INNATE

FLAT • 1 POINT

An effect with this modifier is an innate part of your na-
ture  and  unaffected  by  Nullify  (see  the  Nullify  effect  in
this  chapter).  Gamemasters  should  exercise  caution  in
allowing  the  application  of  Innate;  the  effect  must  be  a
truly inborn or essential trait, such as an elephant’s size or
a ghost’s incorporeal nature. If the effect is not something
normal to the character’s species or type, it probably isn’t
innate.

INSIDIOUS

FLAT • 1 POINT

This  modifier  is  similar  to  the  Subtle  modifier  (later  in
this  section),  except  Insidious  makes  the  result  of  an
effect  harder  to  detect  rather  than  the  effect  itself.  For
example, a target suffering from Insidious Damage isn’t
even aware he’s been damaged. Someone affected by an
Insidious Weaken feels fine until some deficiency makes
it obvious that he’s weaker, and so forth. A target of an
Insidious effect may remain unaware of the danger until
it’s too late!

An  Insidious  effect  is  detectable  either  by  a  DC  20  skill
check  (usually  Perception,  although  skills  like  Expertise,
Insight, or Treatment may apply in other cases) or a par-
ticular unusual sense, such as an Insidious magical effect
noticeable by Detect Magic or Magical Awareness.

Note that Insidious does not make the effect itself harder
to notice; apply the Subtle modifier for that. So it is pos-
sible for an active Insidious effect to be noticeable: the tar-
get can perceive the use of the effect, but not its results:
the effect appears “harmless” or doesn’t seem to “do any-
thing” since the target cannot detect the results.

LINKED

FLAT • 0 POINTS

This modifier applies to two or more effects, linking them
together so they only work in conjunction as one.

The  Linked  effects  must  operate  at  the  same  range.
The  action  required  to  use  the  combined  effects  is  the
longest of its components and they use a single attack
check  (if  one  is  required)  and  resistance  check  (if  both
effects  use  the  same  type  of  check).  If  the  effects  have
different  resistances,  targets  check  against  each  effect
separately.  Different  Alternate  Effects  cannot be  Linked
since they can’t be used at the same time by definition.
Generally, the same effect c

TASK

Diagnose injuries and ailments.

Provide long-term care.

Revive dazed or stunned characters.

Stabilize dying character.

Treat diseases or poisons.

If  you  do  not  have  the  appropriate  medical  equipment
and supplies, you take a –5 circumstance penalty on your
check.  If  your  subject  has  a  particularly  unusual  biology
(an alien, for example) you may also suffer a circumstance
penalty.

You  can  use  the Treatment  skill  on  yourself,  but  only  to
diagnose,  provide  care,  or  treat  disease  or  poison.  You
take a –5 circumstance penalty on checks when treating
yourself.
DIAGNOSIS

You  can  diagnose  injuries  and  ailments  with  an  eye  to-
ward  further  treatment.  This  takes  at  least  a  minute.  At
the GM’s discretion, a successful diagnosis provides a +2
bonus  for  favorable  circumstances  on  further Treatment
checks.

Providing  care  means  treating  an  injured  patient  for  a
day or more. If successful, the patient further reduces the
recovery  time  by  1  rank  (see  Recovery  in  the  Action  &
Adventure chapter). You can provide care for up to your
Treatment rank in patients at one time.
REVIVE

You  can  remove  the  dazed  or  stunned  conditions  from
a  subject  (see  Conditions  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). The check to revive is a standard action. A suc-
cessful  check  removes  the  condition.  Other  conditions
the patient may have remain, so reviving someone inca-
pacitated due to fatigue still leaves the patient exhaust-
ed, for example, while awakening someone incapacitat-
ed due to damage still leaves the patient staggered. You

As a standard action, a successful Treatment check stabi-
lizes a dying character.

You can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison.
Each time the character makes a resistance check against
the ailment, you make a Treatment check. One degree of
success provides the patient with a +2 circumstance bo-
nus to the resistance check, three or more degrees of suc-
cess provides a +5 circumstance bonus.

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

As you can see, once you break it down, checks are actual-
ly fairly simple. All the Gamemaster has to say in response
to the player’s declaration is: “Okay, roll a Fighting check
to hit the villain,” letting the rest of the description stand
as what happens. Whether or not the hero is successful in
stopping the trap depends on the outcome of the attack
against the bad guy.

Of course, if the villain is expecting the hero, there might be
another trap, such as part of the catwalk rigged to fall away
under him, leaving him dangling above the acid vat and at
the villain’s mercy! In that case, the GM would respond to
the  player’s  description: “You  smash  through  the  skylight
and swing over to the catwalk, but when you do...” and go
on to describe what follows. The rest of the hero’s intended
action(s) are null and void, because things don’t always go
as planned when you’re dealing with cunning supervillains!

Checks are used to resolve all outcomes in MUTANTS & MAS-
TERMINDS,  so  once  you  understand  the  basic  concept,  the
rest is easy. For detailed examples of how to use checks in
the game and their effects, see the Action & Adventure
chapter.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored a critical success. Determine the degree of success
normally and then increase it by one degree. This can turn
a low-level success into something more significant, but
more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-fledged
success! A critical success with an attack check is called a
critical hit, discussed later in this chapter and in the Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter.

Checks are made against a difficulty class or DC, a num-
ber set by the GM, which your check must equal or exceed
to achieve success. So for a task with a DC of 15 you must
roll a check total of 15 or greater to succeed. In some cas-
es, the results of a check vary based on how much higher
or lower the result is than the DC, known as its degree of
success or failure.

Also  note  that,  in  spite  of  the  name,  not  all “deathtraps”
are  necessarily  lethal.  Some  may  be  intended  to  merely
incapacitate and capture intruders (more along the lines
of  a  nonlethal  Defense  System),  allowing  the  villain  to
interrogate them...and then perhaps put them into a real
deathtrap!

The  headquarters  has  a  portal  or  gateway  to  another
dimension or dimensions. This can range from an other-
wise  innocuous-looking  door  to  a  humming  high-tech
portal  surrounded  by  support  equipment  and  monitors.
The portal provides two-way travel to and from the other
dimension,  and  it  may  even  reach  a  number  of  related
dimensions.  At  the  GM’s  discretion,  an  appropriate  skill
check—typically  Expertise  or  Technology—may  be  re-
quired to operate the portal.

DOCK

A  dock  houses  water  vehicles  and  includes  access  to  a
nearby waterway, an airlock or lock system for moving ve-
hicles in and out of the dock, and dry-dock facilities for re-
pairing and maintaining water vehicles. The headquarters
should be located within reasonable distance of a body of
water to have this feature.
DUAL SIZE

The  headquarters  has  two  separate  Size  categories:  its
inside category (purchased normally), which determines
the  structure’s  interior  space,  and  an  outside  category,
one or more size categories smaller. In essence, the head-
quarters is larger on the inside than on the outside! So
a  small  house,  for  example,  might  contain  the  space
of a huge castle on the inside. The GM may even allow
size  categories  beyond  Awesome,  with  each  additional
category doubling size; expensive HQs could be pocket
universes!  Pay  the  cost  of  the  larger  size,  plus  this  fea-
ture,  which  lets  you  set  the  exterior  size  at  any  smaller
category.

In general, the exterior dimensions of the HQ cannot be
smaller than a miniscule structure, about the size of a clos-
et or phone booth (or, say, a wardrobe or police box), large
enough  for  an  adult  human  to  pass  through  whatever
serves as the base’s entrance. Headquarters that have no
“exterior” structure, such as an extra-dimensional fortress
accessed by a magical talisman, do not have this feature,
but instead have things like Dimensional Portal, Isolated,
Sealed, and the like.

A  headquarters  can  be  given  any  appropriate  power  ef-
fect as a feature with the Gamemaster’s approval. The ef-

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

DISGUISE

You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change
your appearance. Your Deception check result determines
the effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others’ Per-
ception check results. The GM makes the Deception check
secretly so you are not sure exactly how well your disguise
holds up under scrutiny.

Disguise  is  heavily  dependent  on  circumstances:  favor-
able ones include appropriate costuming and a subject
resembling your normal appearance, while unfavorable
circumstances include disguising yourself as a member
of a different race or sex, or not having sufficient props
(which can be up to a –5 modifier). If you are imperson-
ating  a  particular  individual,  anyone  who  knows  that
individual gets a circumstance bonus to the Perception
check: regular associates get a +2, while friends get a +5
and intimate loved ones a +10.

Successfully  acting  like  who  you  appear  to  be  may  also
require a Deception check with a DC equal to the observ-
er’s Insight check, modified by familiarity if the observer
knows the subject well, as mentioned previously.

A disguise normally requires at least 10 minutes of prepa-
ration.  The  GM  makes  Perception  checks  for  those  who
encounter you immediately upon meeting you and each
hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.

FEINTING

You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an
opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a stan-
dard action opposed by the better of your target’s Decep-
tion or Insight. If your Deception check succeeds, the tar-
get is vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of
your next round (see Vulnerable in the Conditions sec-
tion of The Basics chapter).
INNUENDO

You  can  use  Deception  to  send  covert  messages  using
word-play and double-meanings while apparently talking
about other things. The DC for a basic message is 10. Com-
plex messages or messages trying to communicate new
information have DCs of 15 or 20, respectively. The recipi-
ent of the message must make a Insight check against the
same DC to understand it.

You  render  the  target  unable  to  breathe.  Targets  fail-
ing  the  Fortitude  resistance  check  against  your  effect
DC become dazed, stunned, and finally incapacitated,
passing out from the lack of oxygen. A failed attempt
to  resist  the  ongoing  effect  of  Suffocation  causes  the
target’s condition to worsen by one degree.

ent than “heat ray” is a descriptor for a Damage effect or
“sticky webbing” is a descriptor for a hindering Affliction;
in  neither  case  does  the  character  need  Summon  Heat
Ray or Summon Webbing to create the desired powers!

SWIMMING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-

then  invisible  beings  are  visible  to  you.  For  5  ranks,  the
sense type ignores all Concealment effects, regardless of
descriptor. Concealed subjects seem slightly “off” to you,
enough  to  know  they  are  concealed  to  others. This  trait
does not affect concealment provided by opaque objects,
for that, see Penetrates Concealment.

2 RANKS

A sense type with this trait ignores the Illusion effect; you
automatically succeed on your resistance check against the
illusion if it affects your sense type, realizing that it isn’t real.

1 RANK

This  is  essentially  the  same  as  Counters  Concealment
(Darkness).
DETECT

1-2 RANKS

You can sense a particular item or effect by touch with a
Perception check. Detect has no range and only indicates
the  presence  or  absence  of  something  (being  neither
acute  nor  accurate).  Choose  what  sense  type  your  De-
tect falls under (often mental). For 2 ranks you can detect
things at range (with the normal –1 per 10 feet modifier to
your Perception check).

1 RANK

When you would normally be surprised in combat, make
a Perception check (DC 10): One degree of success means
you’re  not  surprised,  but  can’t  act  during  the  surprise
round  (so  you  don’t  suffer  any  conditions  of  being  sur-
prised), while two or more degrees of success means you
are not surprised and may act during the surprise round
(if any). Failure means you are surprised (although, if you
have  Uncanny  Dodge,  you  are  not  vulnerable).  The  GM
may raise the DC of the Danger Sense check in some cir-
cumstances. Choose a sense type for your Danger Sense.
Sensory effects targeting that sense also affect your Dan-
ger Sense ability and may “blind” it.

2 RANKS

You can see in complete darkness as if it were normal day-
light;  darkness  provides  no  concealment  to  your  vision.

You always know what direction north lies in and can re-
trace your steps through any place you’ve been.

You can accurately and automatically judge distances.

You  have  a  sense  that  operates  at  greater  than  normal
range.  Your  range  with  the  sense—the  distance  used
to  determine  penalties  to  your  Perception  check—is  in-
creased by a factor of 10. Each additional time you apply
this option, your range increases by an additional factor
of 10, so 1 rank means you have a –1 to Perception checks
per 100 feet, 2 ranks makes it –1 per 1,000 feet, and so

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

Identity:  Some  Powerhouses  keep  their  identity  a
secret  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Especially  those
Powerhouses  that  can  change  into  and  out  of  their

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  Many  Powerhouses  are
die-hard  patriots  and  fight  to  defend  or  represent

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

149

Spread throughout this section are boxes like this one,
providing  examples  of  some  of  the  most  common
powers  found  amongst  superhero  characters  to  give
you a “menu” of pre-fabricated powers to choose from
when  creating  your  own  heroes  (and  villains)  in  MU-
MASTERMINDS.  Sample  powers  are  presented  on
the Power Effects table in italics.

Each power is presented in the following format:

NAME

Effect(s): Modifier(s) • Cost

Name: What the power is called. Feel free to mod-
ify the name to suit how you’re using the power.

Effects: The power’s effect or effects are listed by
name.

Modifiers:  Any  modifiers  applying  to  the  effect
are  listed  with  it.  If  a  power  has  multiple  effects,
each is listed with its applicable modifiers.

Cost: Lastly, the power’s cost is given. This is a cost
per rank of the power if it has a ranked effect, oth-
erwise it is a flat cost in power points. Some pow-
ers may have a flat cost for the initial power, plus a
cost per rank for additional ranks.

Effect: Varies, Activation • effects total –1 or 2 points

isting degrees on the target. For example, if you hit a target
and impose a vulnerable condition (one degree), then at-
tack again and get one degree on the effect, you impose
the Affliction’s second degree condition. +1 cost per rank.

Extra  Condition:  Your  Affliction  imposes  an  additional
condition per degree of success. So with one application of
this extra, your Affliction imposes two conditions—such as
dazed  and  hindered,  or  impaired  and  vulnerable—rather
than just one. With two applications, it imposes three con-
ditions,  and  so  forth.  Since  mutually  incompatible  condi-
tions  are  largely  wasted,  Afflictions  with  this  extra  often
have the Limited Degree flaw as well. +1 cost per rank.

Progressive: This modifier causes an Affliction to increase
incrementally  without  any  effort  from  you.  If  the  target
fails  a  resistance  check  to  end  the  Affliction,  it  not  only
persists, but increases in effect by one degree! So a target
affected by the first degree of a Progressive Affliction who
fails to resist progresses to the second degree of the effect
at the start of his next round. A successful resistance check
still ends the Affliction, as usual. +2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Instant Recovery: Similar to the Reversible extra (see p.
196),  the  target  of  an  Affliction  effect  with  this  modifier
recovers  automatically,  no  c

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

SNARE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Extra  Condition,
Resisted by Dodge, Limited Degree • 3 points per rank

You can restrain a target with bonds of ice, glue, web-
bing, bands of energy, and so forth (whatever suits your
descriptors). The target makes a Dodge resistance check
against your effect DC. One degree of failure leaves the
target hindered and vulnerable, while two results in the
target becoming defenseless and immobilized. There is
no additional effect for three or more degrees of failure.

The resistance check to break out of a Snare is based on
Damage (including Strength Damage) or Sleight of Hand,
either breaking the effect or slipping out of it. This is part of
the power’s Alternate Resistance, with no change in cost.

Mental Link: You  have  a  mental  link  with  your  minions,
allowing you to communicate with them and issue orders
telepathically like the Communication Link effect (see the
Senses effects in this chapter). Flat +1 point.

Multiple  Minions:  You  can  summon  more  than  one
minion. Each application of this extra doubles your total
number of minions. So, for example, with Summon 6, you
summon a single 90-point minion. With Multiple Minions
1, you can summon two 90-point minions, with Multiple
Minions  2,  four  minions,  and  so  forth.  It  requires  a  stan-
dard action to summon each minion unless you also have
the Horde extra (see previous). +2 cost per rank.

STRIKE

Effect: Damage • 1 point per rank

You  inflict  additional  damage  in  close  combat.  Your
Strike  either  substitutes  for  your  Strength  damage  or
adds  to  it,  if  it  is  Strength-based,  see  the  Damage  ef-
fect for details. It might be claws, energy fields, focused
striking  strength,  or  something  similar,  depending  on
your  descriptors.  Close  combat  weapons  are  either
equipment or this power with the Removable flaw. See
the Gadgets & Gear chapter (following) for more infor-
mation.

Sacrifice: When you are hit with an effect requiring a resis-
tance check, you can spend a hero point to shift it to one
of your minions instead. The minion must be within range
of the effect and a viable target. Needless to say, this is not
a particularly heroic ability. In fact, the GM may wish to re-
strict  it  to  villains  or  non-player  characters  (in  which  case
a hero earns a hero point when a villain uses this extra to
avoid an effect by sacrificing a minion). Flat +1 point.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

A  common  piece  of  equipment  for  crime  fighters  and
espionage agents is the utility belt (or bag, pouch, back-
pack, etc.): a collection of useful tools and equipment in
a compact carrying case. A utility belt is an array of Alter-
nate Equipment. Some characters may have a Removable
array of devices instead, allowing for far more unusual ef-
fects than run-of-the-mill equipment.

Note  that  equipment  with  a  cost  of  1  equipment  point
doesn’t  really  need  to  be  acquired  as  Alternate  Equip-
ment,  since  there’s  no  change  in  cost.  Still,  heroes  often
have 1-point items in their utility belts, like flashlights, re-
breathers, and so forth.

By spending hero points you can temporarily add Alter-
nate  Equipment  to  your  utility  belt,  for  those  one-time
items you may need in a pinch.

Feel  free  to  modify  this  example  (adding  or  omitting
items)  to  create  your  own  customized  utility  belts. The
tear gas, as the most expensive effect, has full cost. The
other items cost 1 point each for Alternate Equipment,
making the total equipment point cost of the utility belt
25  equipment  points,  or  5  power  points  (for  5  ranks  of
the Equipment advantage).

jects cannot have their selectivity changed once they are
created. +1 cost per rank.

Stationary:  Your  created  objects  can  hang  immobile
in  the  air. They  resist  being  moved  with  a  Strength  rank
equal to the modifier rank. Unless you have the Tether ex-
tra  or  the  Movable  extra,  you  cannot  move  a  stationary
created object once it’s placed any more than anyone else
can. +0 cost per rank.

Subtle:  This  modifier  either  makes  created  objects  not
noticeable as constructs for 1 rank (they look just like real
objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects
composed of invisible force). Flat +1or 2 points.

Tether: You  have  a  connection  to  your  created  objects,
allowing  you  to  exert  your  own  Strength  to  move  them
(provided you are strong enough to do so). Flat 1 point.
FLAWS

Feedback: You may suffer damage when your created ob-
jects are damaged (see the Feedback flaw description for
details). -1 cost per rank.

Permanent:  Permanent  created  objects  last  until  de-
stroyed or nullified. Unlike Continuous Create, you cannot
choose to dismiss such objects; they are truly permanent.
You  cannot  repair  permanent  created  objects  or  other-
wise alter them once they’re created. +0 cost per rank (for
a Sustained effect).

Proportional: Your  created  objects  have  a  total  volume
rank plus Toughness rank equal to your Create rank, rather

than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you
can create an object with volume rank 0 and Toughness
equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in be-
tween, so long as the sum of the two ranks does not ex-
ceed your Create rank. –1 cost per rank.

DAZZLE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Limited  to  One
Sense • 2 points per rank

You can overwhelm one of the target’s senses, chosen
when  you  take  this  effect.  The  target  makes  a  Forti-
tude  or  Will  resistance  check  against  your  effect  DC
(choose one when you acquire the effect). One degree
of failure leaves the sense impaired (–2 penalty). Two
degrees leave it disabled (–5 penalty) while three de-
grees  leave  the  sense  unaware: The  target  automati-
cally fails Perception checks involving the sense, and
everything effectively has total concealment from that
sense.

The target makes a new resistance check at the end of
each  turn  to  recover.  Success  removes  the  condition
imposed by the Dazzle power. Failure

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

157

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

ample,  Enhanced  Strength  5  increases  your  Strength  by
+5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to
power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be be-
low the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement
to accommodate it.

You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your
reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to de-
termine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized hu-
man (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2,
and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles!
“Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action.

The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquir-
ing a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that
Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait,
and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and
other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and
Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a great-
er  distance  by  elongating  your  limbs.  Once  elongated,
you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a
standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target
(you’re  elongating  around  a  corner,  for  example),  apply
the  rules  for  concealment  (see  Concealment  in  the  Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows
you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a
+1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: As base Trait

You  can  temporarily  improve  one  of  your  existing  traits,

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

107

Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.

STRENGTH (STR)

INTELLECT (INT)

Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to
apply it. Your Strength rank applies to:

•

Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based
attacks.
How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).
The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.
Athletics skill checks.

•
•
•
STAMINA (STA)

Stamina  is  health,  endurance,  and  overall  physical  resil-
ience.  Stamina  is  important  because  it  affects  a  charac-
ter’s ability to resist most forms of damage. Your Stamina
modifier applies to:

•
•

•

Toughness defense, for resisting damage.
Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your
character’s health.
Stamina  checks  to  resist  or  recover  from  things  af-
fecting  your  character’s  health  when  a  specific  de-
fense doesn’t apply.

AGILITY (AGL)

Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coor-
dination. Your Agility rank applies to:

•

•
•
•

Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and oth-
er hazards.
Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.
Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.
Agility  checks  for  feats  of  coordination,  gross  move-
ment, and quickness when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

DEXTERITY (DEX)

Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  hand-eye  coordination,  preci-
sion, and manual dexterity. Your Dexterity rank applies to:

•
•
•

Attack checks for ranged attacks.
Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.
Dexterity  checks  for  feats  of  fine  control  and  preci-
sion when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

FIGHTING (FGT)

Fighting  measures  your  character’s  ability  in  close  com-
bat, from hitting a target to ducking and weaving around
any counter-attacks. Your Fighting rank applies to:

•
•

Attack checks for close attacks.
Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.

Intellect covers reasoning ability and learning. A character
with a high Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and
well-educated. Your Intellect modifier applies to:

•

•

Expertise,  Investigation, Technology,  and Treatment
skill checks.
Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-
power when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

AWARENESS (AWE)

While  Intellect  covers  reasoning,  Awareness  describes
common sense and intuition, what some might call “wis-
dom.” A character with a high Intellect and a low Aware-
ness may be an “absent-minded professor” type, smart

+/–5  for  major  benefits  or  penalties. This  allows  you
to assign modifiers for almost any situation on the fly,
without having to look things up and slow down the
game while puzzling out all the pluses and minuses.

Extra Effort: When players want their characters to
pull  off  something  outlandish,  rather  than  saying
“no” let them try but make them pay for it by count-
ing it as extra effort (see Extra Effort, page 19). Extra
effort  already  allows  players  to  pull  off  all  kinds  of
stunts, so there’s no reason you can’t expand the list.
This  works  particularly  well  with  innovative  uses  of
powers. Since extra effort allows a character to per-
form power stunts, it can cover a lot of ground.

Hero Points: Like extra effort, hero points allow char-
acters to pull off amazing stunts. If a player wants to
do something that isn’t normally a part of the char-
acter’s abilities, require a hero point to make the at-
tempt.  The  hero  point  doesn’t  do  anything  but  let
the  character  try  something  outlandish,  and  play-
ers won’t be able to pull off such stunts all the time
because they have a limited number of hero points
to spend. Still, it allows for those amazing, one-of-a-
kind stunts that happen in the comic books.

Even Gamemasters are only human. Sooner or later, you’ll
make a mistake, whether it’s forgetting a particular rule or
overlooking something about a character or an element
of the story. Don’t worry, it happens, and it doesn’t mean
your game is ruined!

The best way to handle a mistake is to own up to it. Tell
your players you screwed up and need to make a change
in order to keep the game fair, and fun. For example, if you
allow a new power into the game and it turns out it’s way
more powerful and useful than you thought, and it’s ruin-
ing everyone else’s fun, that’s a problem. Tell your players
you made a mistake letting that power into the game in
the first place and you have to change the way it works in
order to make the game fun and fair for everyone.

Be reasonable and straightforward in handling your mis-
takes and your players are much more likely to be coop-
erative and understanding about them when they (inevi-
tably) happen.

Some staples of the comic books, while enjoyable in the
stories themselves, don’t always translate well to the me-
dium of roleplaying games. You might want to take these
“translation issues” into account when planning your ad

though you can move (move action) and then attack (stan-
dard  action)  or  attack  and  then  move,  you  cannot  move
half  your  distance,  attack,  and  then  move  the  other  half
unless you have some special trait that allows you to do so.

At the end of your turn, you should:

•

End any effects that last “until the end of your turn”.

•  Make  any  necessary  resistance  checks  to  recover

You  can  use  extra  effort  in  order  to  take  an  additional
standard or move action on your turn (see Extra Effort on
page 19).

•

from ongoing effects.

Inform the Gamemaster and other players that your
turn is finished, allowing the next character in the ini-
tiative order to go.

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game terms, a challenge is an action or series of actions where players are called upon to make
checks of their characters’ traits, but which do not involve direct conflict, such as fighting. Some challenges are quick
and involve only a single character, such as a hero making a daring leap or acrobatic maneuver, while others are more
involved and require the efforts of a whole team, such as clearing all of the people out of a burning building or search-
ing the entire city (or world!) for an escaped criminal.

The challenges given in this section are by no means the only possible ones. They simply cover the major “building
blocks” Gamemasters can use to create challenges in their own games and offer examples. Feel free to come up with
your own challenges to test the heroes’ abilities and give the players an opportunity to come up with clever plans of
their own.

Challenges may or may not involve initiative checks, de-
pending on the nature of the challenge.

If all of the characters get a turn and it does not particu-
larly matter who goes first, then the Gamemaster can dis-
pense with initiative for the challenge. For example, if the
heroes  all  have  to  leap  across  a  chasm,  then  it  is  a  chal-
lenge they must all complete, and it does not particularly
matter which of them goes first or last in doing so (since
their actions are all virtually simultaneous).

With other challenges, it does matter who goes first, par-
ticular when the challenge is timed in some fashion. So,
for example, if the GM determines that part of a burning
building will collapse after the first round, initiative may
be  checked  to  see  which  heroes  go  before  the  collapse

ing  Damage  resisted  by  Fortitude.  At  the  GM’s  discre-
tion,  radiation  exposure  can  lead  to  other  effects,  such
as damage to a hero’s power ranks (causing a temporary
decrease in powers).
VACUUM

The primary hazards of the vacuum of space are lack of air
and exposure to unfiltered ionizing radiation.

On  the  third  round  of  exposure  to  vacuum,  a  character
must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  20)  each  round
or suffer from aeroembolism (“the bends”). A failed check
means excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in the
creature’s  bloodstream;  the  creature  is  stunned  and  re-
mains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure.
Two or more degrees of failure impose the incapacitated
condition.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though
holding one’s breath in vacuum damages the lungs. A char-
acter who attempts to hold his breath must make a Forti-
tude check (DC 15) every round; the DC increases by 1 each
round, and on a successful check the character loses a rank
of Stamina (from the pressure on the linings of his lungs). If
the check fails, or when the character simply stops holding
his breath, he begins to suffocate: the next round, he be-
comes incapacitated . The following round, he’s dying and
cannot stabilize until returned to a normal atmosphere.

Unfiltered  radiation  bombards  any  character  trapped  in
the vacuum of space without protective gear, see Radia-
tion, previously.

Heroes able to ignore the effects of deep space must have
Immunity to suffocation, vacuum, and radiation, at a mini-
mum. See the Immunity effect in the Powers chapter for
details.

CONFLICTS

A conflict is when two or more characters go up against each other, typically in a fight of some sort. Conflict between
heroes and villains is a prime part of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS and a big element of the fun, just like the colorful and spec-
tacular fights in the superhero comic books.

ATTACKS

An attack check represents an attempt to hit a target with
an attack. When you make an attack check, roll the die and
add your bonus with that attack. If your result equals or
exceeds  the  target’s  defense,  your  attack  hits  and  may
have some effect.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus vs.
defense class

When you make an attack check and get a natural 20 (the
d20 actually shows 20), you automatically hit, regardless
of  your  target’s  defense,  and  you  score  a  threat. The  hit
might also

round, which limits its usefulness in responding to the ac-
tions of others. –1 cost per rank.

Ranged: Luck Control normally requires no attack check;
if Ranged, it does. –1 cost per rank.

Resistible: Targets  of  your  Luck  Control  get  a  resistance
check—usually Dodge or Will—to avoid its effects. –1 cost
per rank.

Side Effect: As a particular side effect of Luck Control, if
your  effort  to  alter  luck  fails,  you  suffer  a  setback  with-
out earning a hero point. Effectively the GM gains a “free”
complication against you. –1 or –2 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Effect:  Perception  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Re-
sisted by Will • 4 points per rank

You  can  impose  your  will  on  others,  forcing  them  to
obey  your  commands. Targets  failing  a Will  resistance
check against your effect DC first become dazed, then
compelled, as they try to fight off your influence. Finally,
with  three  or  more  degrees  of  effect,  the  target  be-
comes controlled and obeys any commands you give.

Degrees  of  failure  on  resistance  checks  against  Mind
Control are cumulative. You can also apply the Progres-
sive modifier (see the Affliction effect) so your mental
hold  increases  each  time  the  target  fails  a  resistance
check against it!

Action: Standard • Range: Perception
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 point per rank

MIMIC

You can read another character’s mind. To use Mind Read-
ing,  make  an  opposed  effect  check  against  the  result  of
the target’s Will check. The degree of success determines
the degree of contact:

Surface  thoughts: You  can  read  what  the
target  is  presently  thinking.  Mind  Reading
transcends language; you comprehend the
target’s thoughts whether or not you share
a common language.

Personal thoughts: You can probe deeper
into  the  target’s  mind  for  information. You
can  essentially  ask  any  one  question  and
receive  the  answer  from  the  target’s  mind.
If the target doesn’t know the answer, then
you know that as well.

Memory: You can read the subject’s memo-
ries  and  recollections.  This  allows  you  to
perceive  them  exactly  as  the  target  recalls
them, one memory per round.

Subconscious:  You  can  read  memories
from the target’s subconscious, things even
the  target  does  not  consciously  know. This
might mean repressed or hidden memories,
deep-seated psychological traumas, or even
other personalities.

manoids, animals, machines, and so forth. At rank 4 you
can assume any form of the same mass as your own.

For the ability to change size as well as appearance see the
Growth and Shrinking effects. To take on the other traits of
forms you assume, see the Metamorph extra, following, or
the Variable effect, later in this chapter.
EXTRAS

Attack:  A  Morph  Attack  imposes  a  different  appearance
on  the  target  creature.  Unlike  an  Affliction  that  imposes
the transformed condition, a Morph Attack is entirely cos-
metic: you can’t change the target’s traits other than ap-
pearance. +0 cost per rank.

Metamorph:  Morph  only  changes  your  appearance;  you
still  have  all  the  traits  of  your  normal  form. This  modifier
allows  you  to  have  an  alternate  set  of  traits,  essentially  a
complete  alternate  character  you  change  into,  one  set  of
traits per rank in Metamorph. You can switch between sets
of traits at will, once per round, as a free action. Your other
form(s) must have the same point total as you and are sub-
ject  to  the  same  power  level  limits. They  must  also  have
traits  suitable  to  your  Morph  effect.  For  example,  if  you
can only Morph into humanoid forms, then your alternate
forms all have to be humanoid. All of your forms must have
your full Morph effect as well; those power points cannot
be reallocated. The GM may require certain additional com-
mon traits for all of your forms, particularly mental abilities
and skills, if you retain them. Metamorph is best suited to
characters with defined sets of alternate traits. For a char-
acter able to transform into a virtually unlimited number of
forms with various traits, see the Variable effect later in this
chapter. Flat +1 point per rank of Metamorph.
FLAWS

Resistible: A Morph effect Resistible by Will is most likely
a mental illusion of some sort. Observers who succeed on
the Will  resistance  check  see  you  as  you  truly  are  rather
than in your Morph guise. This is in addition to the usual
Perception check to penetrate your disguise. If you have
the Metamorph extra, then targets that resist your effect
treat you as if you had your normal traits, and not those
granted by your Metamorph form. –1 cost per rank.
