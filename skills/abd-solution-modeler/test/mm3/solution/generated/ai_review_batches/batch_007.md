CHAPTER 6: POWERS

151

Others with an acute sense able to detect your Commu-
nication  medium  can “tap  into”  your  transmissions  with
a Perception check (DC 10 + your Communication rank).
The eavesdropper must be within normal sensory range
of you or the receiver. With two degrees of success on the
check, the eavesdropped can also understand your trans-
missions. Effects like Concealment and Dazzle that target
your  Communication  medium  can  “jam”  or  block  your
transmissions.
EXTRAS

Area: You  can  broadcast  omni-directionally  to  every  re-
ceiver  within  your  maximum  Communication  range  at
once. Note this extra is only strictly necessary to commu-
nicate  with  everyone  over  a  wide  area  all  at  once;  since
using  and  maintaining  Communication  are  free  actions,
the GM may allow a communicator to establish and main-
tain contact with multiple discrete receivers—such as the
members  of  the  same  team—all  in  the  same  round.  +1
cost per rank.

Dimensional:  Communication  with  this  modifier  can
bridge  dimensional  barriers,  reaching  into  other  dimen-
sions and planes of existence. The Communication effect
still has its proximate range, and the GM may rule certain
subjects “out of range” of the effect, depending on their
relative positions in the other dimension. Flat +1 point.

Rapid: Your  communication  occurs  10  times  faster  than
normal speech. Each additional rank increases communi-
cation speed by a factor of 10. This is useful for high-speed
computer  links, “deep  sharing”  psychic  rapports,  and  so
forth. Flat +1 point.

Selective:  If  you  have  the  Area  extra,  you  can  choose
which receiver(s) within range get your Communication,
excluding  everyone  else.  This  allows  you  to  go  from  a
single receiver (point-to-point) to all potential receivers in
range (omni-directional) or anywhere in between. +1 cost
per rank.

Subtle:  Your  Communication  cannot  be  “overheard”  (it
is encrypted, scrambled, or otherwise protected). With 2
ranks, your Communication cannot even be detected (that
is,  no  one  can  even  tell  you  are  transmitting,  much  less
what you’re saying). Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Limited:  Communication  may  be  limited  to  only  mem-
bers of a particular group, such as a species, family, mem-
bers  of  an  organization,  and  so  forth. This  is  in  addition
to limitations imposed by medium (that is, requiring sub-
jects to have a means of picking up on the Communica

the  round  in  which  the  duration  ends.  So,  for  example,
an instant duration Affliction only lasts one round, while
a  sustained  duration  Affliction  lasts  until  no  longer  sus-
tained. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Degree: Your Affliction is limited to no more than
two degrees of effect. With two applications of this modi-
fier, it is limited to no more than one degree of effect. –1
cost per rank.

BURROWING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel be-
hind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a
speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Bur-
rowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground
at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard
clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank.
Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional
ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or
collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you
begin burrowing each new tunnel).

Note  that  Burrowing  differs  from  the  Permeate  effect  of
Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle
like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing
it at all (see Movement for details).
EXTRAS

Penetrating:  Normally,  the  hardness  of  the  ground  af-
fects  only  the  speed  at  which  you  burrow.  At  the  GM’s
discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered
Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows
you to dig through them. 1 point per rank.

Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a
greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of
the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Oth-
ers, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone
else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of
the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Limited:  Burrowing  may  be  limited  to  certain  circum-
stances  or  materials,  such  as  only  loose  sand  and  soil

BLAST

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You  can  make  a  damaging  ranged  attack.  It  might  be
a  blast  of  energy,  a  projectile  (arrow,  bullet,  throwing
blade, etc.), or some similar effect. You make a ranged
attack  check  against  the  target’s  Dodge  defense.  The
attack’s damage equals your power rank and the target
makes a Toughness resistance check against it.

use  perception  ranged  effects  via  your  Remote  Sensing.
Despite the built-in limitation, this is an extra, since it al-
lows you to use your Remote Sensing to observe subjects
in relative safety. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous:  You  can  use  both  Remote  Sensing  and
your normal senses at the same time, perceiving two lo-
cales like “translucent” overlays of each other. This means
you’re more capable of taking physical action while also
using  your  Remote  Sensing,  although  the  effect  still  re-
quires its normal duration to maintain. You are not vulner-
able while using your Remote Sensing. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle: Remote Sensing already has a degree of subtlety. Ap-
plying 1 rank of Subtle to Remote Sensing increases the DC
to notice the effect to 20 + rank or makes it noticeable only to
a particular unusual sense (with the usual DC 10 + rank per-
ception check). Subtle 2 makes Remote Sensing completely
unnoticeable, as usual. Flat +1 point per rank of Subtle.
FLAWS

Feedback:  With  this  flaw,  damaging  attacks  directed  at
where you displaced your senses can affect you. Your sen-
sory-point is considered to have partial cover from attacks
and you use your Remote Sensing rank as your Toughness
defense against any successful attack. The feedback may
be psychosomatic in nature or due to some sort of disrup-
tion  caused  by  an  assault  on  the  point  where  you  have
redirected your senses. Note that sensory effects already
work on you via Remote Sensing and this flaw doesn’t ap-
ply to them. –1 cost per rank.

Medium: You  require  a  medium  for  your  Remote  Sens-
ing, such as shadows, flames, mirrors, open water, televi-
sion screens, and so forth. You can only perceive locations
where your chosen medium exists. –1 cost per rank.

Noticeable: Remote Sensing with this flaw has an easily
noticeable display, like a glowing set of eyes or a phantom
image of your face, head, or body at the location you are
observing. This manifestation cannot be used for commu-
nication, however (for that, take the Communication ef-
fect). Flat –1 point.

Sense-Dependent:  Remote  Sensing  is  already  Sense-
Dependent  and  cannot  apply  this  flaw.  Another  effect
might potentially have the flaw Remote-Sensing Depen-
dent, such as an Affliction that targets only remote view-
ers observing a target or an area as a means of blocking or
deterring them.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Subtle:  As  a  mental  sensory  effect,  Mind  Reading  has  a
degree  of  subtlety,  only  noticeable  to  the  subject  or  to
characters  with  an  appropriate  mental  sense,  such  as
Mental  Awareness  (see  the  Senses  effect).  Subtle  Mind
Reading is less detectable, requiring a DC 20 Perception
check  for  either  type  of  character  to  sense  it,  while  two
ranks  of  the  Subtle  modifier  makes  your  Mind  Reading
completely undetectable. Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Close: Applied to Ranged Mind Reading, Close Mind Read-
ing requires a close attack check to touch an unwilling tar-
get and physical contact throughout the effect’s duration;
breaking contact ends the effect. –1 cost per rank.

Feedback: You suffer Feedback if a subject you are reading
is harmed, using your Mind Reading rank as the resistance
check  bonus  against  the  damage.  Additionally,  you  may
suffer Feedback at the GM’s discretion from reading or ex-
periencing  particularly  traumatic  or  emotionally-charged
thoughts of memories from the subject. –1 cost per rank.

Limited by Language: You can only understand the sub-
ject’s thoughts or memories if you share a common lan-
guage. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Emotions: You can only read or probe for emo-
tions and emotional associations, not coherent thoughts
or memories. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Sensory Link: If you have the Sensory Link extra
and this flaw, you can only tap into a subject’s senses, you
cannot read their thoughts or memories. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Surface Thoughts: You can only read surface
thoughts and cannot achieve higher degrees of contact.
–1 cost per rank.

Ranged: Ranged Mind Reading requires a ranged attack
check in addition to the effect’s normal resistance check.
–1 cost per rank.

Sense-Dependent: Your Mind Reading is dependent on
a  sense  other  than  just  having  to  accurately  sense  the
target, such as needing to see his expressions (Sight-De-
pendent), hear him speak (Hearing-Dependent), smell his
changes in biochemistry (Scent-Dependent), and so forth.
Alternately, it may be dependent on first being in Mental
Communication with the target (see Communication). –1
cost per rank.

SNARE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Extra  Condition,
Resisted by Dodge, Limited Degree • 3 points per rank

You can restrain a target with bonds of ice, glue, web-
bing, bands of energy, and so forth (whatever suits your
descriptors). The target makes a Dodge resistance check
against your effect DC. One degree of failure leaves the
target hindered and vulnerable, while two results in the
target becoming defenseless and immobilized. There is
no additional effect for three or more degrees of failure.

The resistance check to break out of a Snare is based on
Damage (including Strength Damage) or Sleight of Hand,
either breaking the effect or slipping out of it. This is part of
the power’s Alternate Resistance, with no change in cost.

Mental Link: You  have  a  mental  link  with  your  minions,
allowing you to communicate with them and issue orders
telepathically like the Communication Link effect (see the
Senses effects in this chapter). Flat +1 point.

Multiple  Minions:  You  can  summon  more  than  one
minion. Each application of this extra doubles your total
number of minions. So, for example, with Summon 6, you
summon a single 90-point minion. With Multiple Minions
1, you can summon two 90-point minions, with Multiple
Minions  2,  four  minions,  and  so  forth.  It  requires  a  stan-
dard action to summon each minion unless you also have
the Horde extra (see previous). +2 cost per rank.

STRIKE

Effect: Damage • 1 point per rank

You  inflict  additional  damage  in  close  combat.  Your
Strike  either  substitutes  for  your  Strength  damage  or
adds  to  it,  if  it  is  Strength-based,  see  the  Damage  ef-
fect for details. It might be claws, energy fields, focused
striking  strength,  or  something  similar,  depending  on
your  descriptors.  Close  combat  weapons  are  either
equipment or this power with the Removable flaw. See
the Gadgets & Gear chapter (following) for more infor-
mation.

Sacrifice: When you are hit with an effect requiring a resis-
tance check, you can spend a hero point to shift it to one
of your minions instead. The minion must be within range
of the effect and a viable target. Needless to say, this is not
a particularly heroic ability. In fact, the GM may wish to re-
strict  it  to  villains  or  non-player  characters  (in  which  case
a hero earns a hero point when a villain uses this extra to
avoid an effect by sacrificing a minion). Flat +1 point.

Accident:  The  Mystic  commands  incredible  super-
natural powers, but sometimes those powers get out
of control, or awaken sleeping horrors, or cause other
unintended consequences that have to be dealt with.

Enemy: Some Mystics are plagued by enemies who
want to displace them or steal their power.

Honor:  It’s  not  uncommon  for  a  Mystic  to  follow  a
code of conduct that keeps them on the straight and
narrow,  perhaps  because  it’s  the  right  thing  to  do,
perhaps because they need to in order to keep their
powers in check.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Mystics  are  often  either
not from Earth or were trained in the mystic arts on
another  world. When  they  come  to  this  plane  they
use their talents to help others and hopefully earn a
place for themselves on their adopted world.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Mystic was given
his  or  her  power  for  a  reason—to  defend  Earth,  to
hunt down otherworldly creatures, or any number of
other options. Or perhaps the Mystic recognizes that
his or her power comes with a price.

•

•

Power  Loss:  Mystics  often  have  the  Complication
that  prevents  them  from  using  their  powers  when
they can’t move and/or speak to cast their spells.

Prejudice: Some Mystics are surrounded by an aura
of “otherness”  that  sets  them  apart  from  the  rest  of
humanity and makes it difficult for them to interact
with others. Or, maybe people just fear witches.

PARAGON

Paragons are what people first think of when they think
of superheroes. A Paragon is nearly perfect in every way:
fast, strong, tough, often has the ability to fly, and repre-
sents everything good about humanity. Paragons are of-
ten talented in a wide range of areas and easily take on
leadership roles.

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

ample,  Enhanced  Strength  5  increases  your  Strength  by
+5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to
power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be be-
low the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement
to accommodate it.

You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your
reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to de-
termine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized hu-
man (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2,
and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles!
“Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action.

The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquir-
ing a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that
Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait,
and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and
other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and
Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a great-
er  distance  by  elongating  your  limbs.  Once  elongated,
you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a
standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target
(you’re  elongating  around  a  corner,  for  example),  apply
the  rules  for  concealment  (see  Concealment  in  the  Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows
you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a
+1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Comic books are full of storylines involving personal complications, and players are encouraged to come up with some
for their heroes. Complications have a specific use in the game as well: they give the Gamemaster a “handle” on your
hero, different challenges to introduce or include in adventures. When the GM does so, you earn hero points you can
use to enhance your character’s chances of success, amongst other things. (See Hero Points in The Basics and Action
& Adventure chapters for more information.)

Choose at least two complications for your hero: a Motiva-
tion and at least one other. You can take as many compli-
cations  as  you  wish,  although  the  GM  may  set  limits  for
the sake of being able to keep track of them all. Compli-
cations  are  also  self-limiting,  in  that  you  only  earn  hero
points  for  those  complications  that  actually  come  into
play.  So  even  if  you  have  more  than  a  dozen,  if  the  GM
can only include a couple in a game session, then those
are the ones that earn you hero points for that game. You
can—and generally should—look for opportunities to in-
clude your hero’s complications and offer suggestions to
the GM, who makes the final decision on which complica-
tions come into play at any given time.

The GM also decides what complications are appropriate
for  the  game  and  can  overrule  any  particular  complica-
tion,  based  on  the  style  and  needs  of  the  story  and  the
series.  Keep  in  mind  the  adventure  needs  to  have  room
for all of the heroes’ complications, so individual ones can
only come up so often.

Every  hero  has  something  that  drove  him  or  her  to  be-
come  a  hero  in  the  first  place—a  motivation  that  keeps
them going when things get tough. Sometimes motiva-
tion  is  the  only  difference  between  a  hero  and  a  villain.
What  made  your  hero  decide  to  fight  for  justice  rather
than turning toward more selfish goals? How does it affect
the  hero’s  methods  of  fighting  crime?  Is  there  anything
that might change or affect the hero’s motivation?

Motivation is a complication because it often determines
what a hero will do in a particular situation. The GM can
use your hero’s motivation to encourage certain actions,
and enemies may do the same. When you properly play
out your hero’s motivation, even if it isn’t necessarily the
“smartest” thing to do, the GM awards you a

To improve your hero’s Toughness, see Advantages and
Powers, following. See the Abilities chapter for details.

Choose  the  skill  ranks  you  want  your  character  to  have
and pay 1 power point per 2 total skill ranks. See the Skills

Choose the advantages you want your character to have

fects  and  paying  the  effects’  base  cost,  adjusted  for  any
modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks. See the
Powers chapter for details.
8. COMPLICATIONS

Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can
have more, if you want, and the more complications your
hero  faces,  the  greater  your  chances  for  earning  hero

points during the game. See the Complications section
of this chapter for details.
9. DETAILS

Go  through  the  limits  listed  under  Power  Level  in  this
chapter and make sure your hero’s traits all fit within them.
If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.

Go back through and add up the costs of your hero’s abili-
ties, defenses, skills, advantages, and powers. You should
end  up  with  a  figure  equal  to  the  starting  power  points
shown on the Starting Power Points table. If not, double-
check your math and either remove or add traits to your
character to reach the starting power point total.

Figure out things like your hero’s name, appearance, origin,
background, and motivation. If you can, consider creating a
sketch or detailed description of your hero’s costume.

10. GAMEMASTER APPROVAL

Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The
GM should check again to make sure your power points
are  spent  and  added  up  correctly,  your  hero  follows  the
power  level  guidelines  and  any  other  guidelines  set  for
the  series,  and  that  the  character  is  generally  complete
and  suited  to  the  overall  game.  Once  your  GM  has  ap-
proved, your new hero is ready for play!

You design a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero by spending pow-
er points on different traits. Each ability, skill, advantage,
power, and other trait has an associated power point cost.

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

larly, you may suffer a circumstance penalty to interaction
when dealing with characters of a strongly differing mo-
tivation.

At the GM’s option motivation can function as a descriptor
for powers (see Descriptors, page 204), allowing character
to  have  a  power  affecting  only  subjects  with  a  particular
motivation,  for  example,  or  the  ability  to  detect  charac-
ters  with  a  particular  motivation  (see  Detect,  page  177).
Gamemasters should be very careful when applying power
modifiers based on subjective qualities like motivation. An
attack  power  affecting  only “evil”  targets,  for  example,  is
useless against inanimate objects, constructs, and animals
(which cannot have such a quality) as well as “good” targets.
It  might  also  not  affect  characters  without  a  specific  evil
motivation (such as selfish mercenaries, violent vigilantes,
or despots devoted solely to order, but not “evil” per se).

Some characters may derive their powers from their mo-
tivation in some way, such as heroes who draw strength
from  their  convictions,  faith,  or  morality. This  provides  a
descriptor for those powers, but the hero may also suffer
Power  Loss  (see  page  28)  from  a  change  or  wavering  in
motivation.

A character with different motivations may find them in
conflict from time to time. Such conflicts provide roleplay-
ing opportunities and complications for players and story
hooks for the Gamemaster. For example, a hero motivated
by Patriotism may discover a secret government agency
acting against the interests of justice in the world. What
is stronger, the hero’s patriotism or the desire to see the
truth known and justice done? Some conflicts may even
result  in  heroes  changing  motivations.  See  Changing
Complications, in the following section, for more on this.

Other  possible  complications,  and  their  uses  in  adven-
tures, include:

•

•

Accident: You cause or suffer some sort of accident.
Perhaps a stray blast damages a building or hurts an
innocent bystander, your fire powers set off sprinkler
systems, or you cause volatile chemicals to explode.
A  hero  with  this  as  a  regular  complication  may  be
especially  accident-prone,  inexperienced  with  their
powers, or even jinxed! The GM decides the effects of
an  accident,  but  they  should  be  troublesome.  Acci-
dents can lead to further complications; perhaps the
hero develops a guilt-complex, obsession, or phobia
involving t

EXTRAS

Area: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets
in the affected area. You spend only one hero point, but
the subjects are each affected individually. You must ap-
ply the same effect to all subjects at once. +1 cost per rank.

Luck: Each rank in this extra gives you the benefit of a rank
in the Luck advantage (see Luck in the Advantages chap-
ter). It is subject to the same limits as the Luck advantage
set by the GM. Flat +1 point per rank of Luck.

Selective: This extra, applied to Area Luck Control, allows
you to choose who in the area is or is not affected by it. +1
cost per rank.

FLAWS

Action: If the action required for Luck Control is increased
beyond a reaction, it is only usable during your turn each

Effect:  Perception  Ranged  Damage,  Resisted  by  Will  •
4 points per rank

You can strike targets’ minds with “mental force,” inflict-
ing  Damage  resisted  by  the  target’s  Will  rather  than
Toughness, but having no effect on targets immune to
effects resisted by Will, such as inanimate objects. Men-
tal Blasts are often, but not always, Subtle as well, which
costs a flat 1 point.

MAGIC

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You are a sorcerer, witch, or wizard, able to cast a variety
of magical spells. Your basic default effect is a Blast of
eldritch  force,  able  to  inflict  Ranged  Damage  (see  the
Blast power, previously).

However,  like  the  Energy  Control  power,  Magic  can
have a wide range of Alternate Effects, each a separate
spell you have mastered. The possibilities are virtually
limitless, within the bounds of your hero’s descriptors
and  the  Gamemaster’s  approval.  Examples  include
mystic  bindings  (Affliction,  see  the  Snare  version),
dispelling  magical  effects  (Nullify  Magic),  conjuring
clouds of mist or fog (an Area Visual Concealment At-
tack), scrying distant places (Remote Sensing), or slip-
ping  between  the  dimensions  to  appear  elsewhere
(Teleport), to name just a few.

All Magic effects have the “magic” descriptor regardless
of their other descriptors, so a Blast of flames conjured
with magic has both the “magic” and “fire” descriptors,
for example.

Magicians  often  have  a  Power  Loss  complication  (see
Complications  in  The  Basics  chapter):  if  they  are  un-
able to freely speak and gesture to cast their spells, they
cannot  use  Magic  (or  any  related  magical  powers  reli-
ant on spellcasting). Certain styles of Magic may impose

use of a tiring effect. In essence, the power requires extra
effort  in  order  to  use  it  (see  Extra  Effort,  page  19). This
makes Tiring a useful flaw for creating an effect you can
only use with extra effort.

Tiring is often applied to just some ranks of an effect to rep-
resent a higher level of the effect, usable only through extra
effort. For example, a hero might have a rank 12 Damage
effect, but routinely use only 8 ranks of it. The remaining
4 ranks are Tiring, so using them quickly fatigues the hero.

A Tiring effect can be combined with extra effort, but the
fatigue stacks, causing a minimum of two levels of fatigue
per use.

-1 COST PER RANK

You have no control over an effect with this flaw. Instead,
the Gamemaster decides when and how it works (essen-
tially  making  it  a  plot  device). This  flaw  is  best  suited  for
mysterious powers out of the characters’ direct control or
effects the GM feels more comfortable having under direct,
rather than player, control.

-1 COST PER RANK

An Unreliable effect doesn’t work all the time. Roll a die
each round before you use or maintain the effect. On a
10 or less, it doesn’t work this round, but you’ve still used
the action the effect requires. You can roll again on the
following  round  to  see  if  it  works,  although  you  must
take  the  normal  action  needed  to  activate  the  effect
again. Spending a hero point on your reliability roll al-

lows you to succeed automatically (since the roll is then
at least an 11).

Alternately,  instead  of  having  a  reliability  roll,  you  can
choose to have five uses where your effect works normal-
ly, then it stops working altogether until you can “recover”
it in some way (see the Fades flaw for more on this). The
GM may allow you to spend a hero point to automatically
recover a spent Unreliable power.

Powers  that  are  only  occasionally  unreliable  (less  than
about 50% of the time) are better handled as complica-
tions (see Complications, page 30).

One possible application of the Unreliable flaw is to re-
flect weapons or equipment that occasionally run out of
ammunition or “jam” or “crash” and must be reloaded or
reset in some way. It really only applies to effects where
this happens fairly often, as given in the Unreliable flaw
description. Large ammo or fuel capacities, which only
occasionally run out or inconvenience the character, are
better handled as descriptors and occasiona

a hero has Agility 6 and is trained in Acrobatics (with a rank
of 7) then the character’s bonus for checks involving feats
of agility covered by Acrobatics is 13 (6 plus 7). Obviously,
training in a skill makes characters more effective at checks
involving that skill, often much more.

For details on what skills are available and what they do,
see the Skills chapter.

Halfway between skills and powers, advantages are minor
benefits characters have, allowing them to do things oth-
ers cannot. They range from special combat maneuvers to
things like financial resources, contacts, and so forth.

Many advantages have no rank, or rather just one rank; a
character either has the advantage (and the benefits that
it grants) or does not. Other advantages may have multiple
ranks, like abilities and skills, measuring their effectiveness.

For details on the various advantages and what they pro-
vide, see the Advantages chapter.

When  using  the  Measurements  Table,  there  are  a  few
important things to keep in mind:

•

•

•

Each rank represents a range of measures. Time
rank  4  is  actually  all  measures  between  1  and  2
minutes, and time rank 16 is everything between 2
and 4 days! So if you’re looking for a measurement
that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one
that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than
8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance
rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).

Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.
In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed
14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds.
You can extend the negative side the Measurement
Table just like you can the positive side, with each
lower  rank  halving  the  previous  measurement.  So
rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3
inches, for example.

Don’t directly add ranks.  Putting  rank  4  distance
together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance!
Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6
is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements,
you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the
ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you
have different ranks, it is best to either handle them
separately  or  convert  them  to  measurements,  add
the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank
7 distance (around half a mile).

•  Measurements  are  approximate.  Especially  at
the higher end, where eac

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

HOOD: COMPLICATIONS AND UP-FRONT REWARDS

Some roleplaying game systems include complications, disadvantages, or similar problematic character traits which offer
“bonus points” for creating the character; essentially, you get more points for your character’s good traits when you take
on some bad ones.

The problem with such “up-front” rewards for giving a character flaws is that the player gets all of the reward (the bo-
nus design points) immediately, but the disadvantage only occasionally limits or affects the character, sometimes even
randomly. Since there is only so much “screen time” in a game session, there is virtually no way for the GM to spotlight
every one of every character’s disadvantages, so some end up being worth “more” in the sense of reward in exchange for
drawbacks. Plus, after they have “paid out” their initial benefit, front-loaded negative traits are nothing but a burden to the
character from that point forward, leading players to try and avoid or mitigate them as much as possible.

Complications address this issue by having a “pay-as-you-go” approach: if the GM uses a complication in the game, and
the player responds by going along with it, the player gets a reward in the form of a hero point. This means that although
the hero has to deal with some “bad stuff” from time to time, there is an upside, and a reason for players to want their
characters’ complications to come into play! Why do powerful heroes lead such complicated lived? They need the points!

•

•

•

•

•

•

When  this  happens,  and  poses  a  challenge  for  you,
your complication comes into play.

Prejudice: You are part of a minority group subject
to  the  prejudices  of  others,  which  create  problems.
Similarly, characters with unusual origins or appear-
ance might face prejudice, such as a demonic-look-
ing hero who is considered suspect. Some Gamemas-
ters and gaming groups may prefer not to deal with
issues of prejudice in their games, in which case the
GM is free to ban this complication.

Quirk:  Complications  can  often  come  from  various
personality  quirks:  likes,  dislikes,  hobbies,  neuroses,
and  so  forth.  For  example,  a  hero  might  have  the
quirk of always leaving some sort of “calling card” for
the authorities along with a captured criminal. That
could become a complication if somebody else starts
imitating it, or uses it to cause trouble for the hero.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

In many instances, players come up with creative uses for their characters’ descriptors. This should be encouraged and,
generally speaking, allowed freely so long as those uses don’t spoil the game. So if a fire-using character wants to use
a tiny amount of his flame blast power to light some candles, or the electrical-controlling character wants to use some
of his power output to act as a living battery to jump-start a car, go for it. In the latter case you might want to call for a
Technology skill check to make sure the character gets the terminals and the voltage right, but most of the time it’s bet-
ter to just let the trick go through and give the character a chance to shine.

Creative uses of descriptors with no real game effect are freebies: no extra effort or hero points needed. Situations
where creative uses of descriptors have a significant game effect can be handled as power stunts: pick the effect that
best suits the desired outcome and treat it as an Alternate Effect of the power the hero wants to use, with descrip-
tors assigned as appropriate. If an electrical-controlling hero wants to use his power like a living defibrillator to save
a heart-attack victim, for example, that can be a Healing power stunt. The hero uses extra effort (and possibly a hero
point) and gets a one-shot use of Healing to stabilize the dying victim.

While  descriptors  are  generally  applied  to  powers  when
those  powers  are  defined  (that  is,  when  a  character  is
created),  in  some  cases,  certain  descriptors  may  be  left
unspecified  and  defined  during  play.  This  can  either  be
because nobody thought to define the descriptor in ad-
vance, or it was deliberately left vague, to be filled-in later.

So, for example, a particular heroine might not know the
origin or source of her powers, and her player doesn’t want
to know, leaving them a mystery for later development in
the game. The GM agrees and so the heroine’s powers have
no  origin  or  source  descriptors.  Instead,  the  GM  chooses
them, which isn’t known until the heroine is subject to an
anti-magical field and discovers her powers don’t work! The
GM awards the player a hero point for the unexpected set-
back and now the source of the heroine’s powers is known,
although their origin still remains a mystery….

Applying descriptors in play gives you a lot of flexibility,
letting you handle certain things “on the fly” rather than

PRINCESS

Julia wants to play a fairly straightforward hero: super-strong and tough, but also a beautiful
young woman with an eye for fashion! She draws a sketch of a smiling, slender woman in a

pink T-shirt that says “Princess” on it in silver sequins, holding a car over her head!

Right off, Julia knows Princess is strong, really strong. So she assigns her Strength 12;
higher than PL10, but still not so high that she can’t also have a reasonable close
combat bonus. That Strength is enough for Princess to lift a hundred tons! She

can heft that car with ease! Julia gives her Stamina 12 to match.

Since she sees Princess as graceful, like a gymnast, Julia gives her Agility
5, but she goes with Dexterity 3, since her character isn’t as coordinated
(although she’s still above average). Likewise, Julia assigns Princess 2 ranks
each  in  Intellect,  Awareness,  and  Presence;  she’s  smart,  sassy,  and  deter-
mined, but not amazingly so. Julia wants Princess to be a capable close-up
fighter, so she gives her Fighting 6. That’s a total of 44 ranks in abilities for 88

power points, leaving 62 remaining.

Next up: powers. Julia wants Princess to be fast and tough. She gives her 4 ranks of
Speed, allowing her to keep up with a slow-moving car, and assigns her 5 ranks in Im-
munity (allowing her to ignore cold, disease, heat, pressure, and radiation) along with some
Impervious Toughness (8 ranks) and Regeneration (2 ranks). That’s 19 points in powers,

43 remaining.

Given her great Strength and Agility, Julia also sees Princess as being able to jump re-
ally far, so she gives her 7 ranks in Leaping as well. That’s another 7 points, leaving 36.

Julia looks over the advantage list, taking notes as she goes. She likes the idea of
Princess being a real toughy: having things like Diehard and Ultimate Tough-
ness,  along  with  Interpose  (allowing  her  to  take  the  hit  for  a  teammate).
But she also wants her to be quick and inspirational. She likes Attractive,
Extraordinary  Effort,  Inspire,  and  Well-informed.  That’s  seven  advan-
tages thus far. She rounds out the list with some combat maneuvers
like All-out Attack and Power Attack (since Princess can cut loose if
she needs to), Improved Initiative (she’s quick) and another rank
of Inspire. That’s another four advantages, for a total of 11 points.

Julia  asks  the  Gamemaster  about  one  more  advantage:

something else that looks more interesting). This method
combines  the  best  of  the  two  options  above  because  it
limits your choices, but also allows you to control, to some
extent, what you get.

Important note: No matter which option you use when
creating  a  character,  feel  free  to  alter  the  results  of  your
rolls to make sure you get a character you find interesting.
This is not cheating! Simply because these tables are in this
book doesn’t make them “rules” that you have to “follow.”
Instead, consider them play aids with guidelines to make
it easier to create your character…because that’s exactly
what they are.

Every superhero has challenges that make his or her life
more…interesting. Just like the characters in the comics,
your  hero  needs  at least  two  Complications;  one  should
be  a  Motivation  and  the  other  (or  others)  is  up  to  you.
Each Archetype lists a number of suggestions appropriate
for that Archetype. This is your hero, so take the Compli-
cations  that  make  the  most  sense  to  you.  If  none  of  the
suggestions work for you, there are more Complications
to choose from in Chapter 2.

Once you have your character’s various traits and Compli-
cations determined and on paper, you’re ready to play! Your
character should be appropriate for a Power Level 10 (PL10)
game, so you can start playing right away without changes.

It’s  possible,  however,  that  you  have  an  advantage  that
doesn’t mesh correctly with your skills. For example, you
might get the Daze (Intimidation), Skill Mastery (Technol-
ogy),  or  Assessment  advantages,  each  of  which  requires
a  specific  skill  to  work  correctly:  Intimidation,  Technol-
ogy, and Insight, respectively. If that’s the case, feel free to
choose a different advantage, or if you like the effect the
advantage gives you, swap one of your skills for the one
you need. Instances in which this is a problem should be
rare, but they can happen.

Another aspect of “pulling it all together” is making sure
the character is interesting to you. Do this by customizing
your character a bit, if necessary. This is your hero, after all!
Gamemaster, you should work with your players to swap
around a few points’ worth of Abilities, Advantages, Skills,
and/or  Powers  so  they  end  up  with  a  character  more  to
their liking. Usually, this process is as simple as replacing
ranks  of  one  effect  for

You  can  raise  the  light  level  in  the  area,  countering  the
concealment of darkness, but not other forms of conceal-

reduce  total  concealment  to  partial  and  partial  conceal-
ment  to  none.  For  2  points  per  rank,  you  can  shed  light
as bright as a sunlit day, eliminating all concealment pro-
vided  by  natural  darkness.  Power  effects  with  the  dark-
ness descriptor may be countered with a successful power
check (see Countering Effects, page 148).

You impose a -2 modifier to Perception checks for 1 point
per rank, and a -5 for 2 points per rank. For more signifi-

As  an  option  for  including  some  combat  benefits  with

ample,  Enhanced  Strength  5  increases  your  Strength  by
+5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to
power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be be-
low the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement
to accommodate it.

You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your
reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to de-
termine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized hu-
man (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2,
and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles!
“Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action.

The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquir-
ing a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that
Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait,
and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and
other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and
Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a great-
er  distance  by  elongating  your  limbs.  Once  elongated,
you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a
standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target
(you’re  elongating  around  a  corner,  for  example),  apply
the  rules  for  concealment  (see  Concealment  in  the  Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows
you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a

It’s ranged, radius, and acute by default.

RADIUS

1-2 RANKS

You can make Perception checks with a radius sense for
any  point  around  you.  Subjects  behind  you  cannot  use
Stealth  to  hide  from  you  without  some  other  conceal-
ment. Auditory, olfactory, and tactile senses are normally
radius for humans. Cost is 1 rank for use with one sense, 2
ranks for one sense type.
RANGED

1 RANK

You can use a sense that normally has no range (taste or
touch  in  humans)  to  make  Perception  checks  at  range,
with the normal –1 per 10 feet modifier. This can be en-
hanced with the Extended Sense effect.

RAPID

1 RANK

You can read or take in information from a sense faster than
normal:  each  rank  increases  your  perception  speed  by  a
factor of 10 (x10, x100, etc.) with a single sense, double cost
for an entire sense type. You can use rapid vision to speed-
read, pick up on rapid flickering between frames of a film,
watch video replays in fast-forward speeds, and such, rapid
hearing to listen to time-compressed audio “blips,” and so
forth.

Precognition  and  Postcognition  can  be  problematic
abilities,  since  they  provide  players  with  considerable
information. Keep in mind precognitive and postcogni-
tive information is often cryptic or unclear, and changes
in circumstances may lead to changes in visions of the
future. If players use either too often, feel free to have
their visions become less and less clear as the timelines
become tangled by so much constant surveillance and
intervention.

Generally, Precognition is best treated as a plot device
for the GM to provide information to the player as suits
the  adventure,  similar  to  a  free  use  of  the  inspiration
ability of hero points. In fact, GMs looking to limit Pre-
cognition and Postcognition may wish to require extra
effort or hero points to use them, or require the Uncon-
trolled modifier.

TRACKLESS

You leave no trail and cannot be tracked using visual sens-

means). You can walk across the surface of soft sand or snow
without leaving tracks and you have total concealment from
tremorsense (see Concealment, page 244). Each additional
rank renders you trackless to another sense type.
WALL-CRAWLING

You can climb walls and ceilings at your ground speed rank
–1 with no chance of falling and no need for an Athletics
check. You are still vulnerable while climbing, however. An
additional rank of this effect means you climb at your full
speed rank and are not vulnerable while climbing.
WATER-WALKING

You can stand or move at your normal ground speed on
the surface of water, quicksand, and other liquids without
sinking. If you fall prone for any reason, you sink into the

prone on a liquid surface without sinking; you only sink if
you choose to.

Nullify  can  counter  particular  effects  of  a  particular  de-
scriptor,  such  as  fire  effects,  magical  effects,  mental  ef-
fects, and so forth (see Countering Effects, at the start of
this chapter). You can counter one effect of your chosen
descriptor per use of Nullify. You can’t nullify innate effects
(see the Innate modifier description).

Make a ranged attack check to hit the target. Then make
an  opposed  check  of  your  Nullify  rank  and  the  targeted
effect’s  rank  or  the  target’s  Will  defense,  whichever  is
higher. If you are targeting the subject of an effect rather
than the effect’s user, make an opposed check of Nullify
rank vs. effect rank. If you win, the targeted effect turns off,
although the user can re-activate it normally. If you lose
the opposed check, you do not Nullify the effect. With two
or more degrees of failure, trying again against the same
subject in the same scene requires extra effort.
EXTRAS

Affects Insubstantial: Nullify does not require this modi-
fier to affect insubstantial targets, or the Insubstantial ef-
fect itself. You can attempt to nullify the effects of insub-
stantial targets normally.

Others with an acute sense able to detect your Commu-
nication  medium  can “tap  into”  your  transmissions  with
a Perception check (DC 10 + your Communication rank).
The eavesdropper must be within normal sensory range
of you or the receiver. With two degrees of success on the
check, the eavesdropped can also understand your trans-
missions. Effects like Concealment and Dazzle that target
your  Communication  medium  can  “jam”  or  block  your
transmissions.
EXTRAS

Area: You  can  broadcast  omni-directionally  to  every  re-
ceiver  within  your  maximum  Communication  range  at
once. Note this extra is only strictly necessary to commu-
nicate  with  everyone  over  a  wide  area  all  at  once;  since
using  and  maintaining  Communication  are  free  actions,
the GM may allow a communicator to establish and main-
tain contact with multiple discrete receivers—such as the
members  of  the  same  team—all  in  the  same  round.  +1
cost per rank.

Dimensional:  Communication  with  this  modifier  can
bridge  dimensional  barriers,  reaching  into  other  dimen-
sions and planes of existence. The Communication effect
still has its proximate range, and the GM may rule certain
subjects “out of range” of the effect, depending on their
relative positions in the other dimension. Flat +1 point.

Rapid: Your  communication  occurs  10  times  faster  than
normal speech. Each additional rank increases communi-
cation speed by a factor of 10. This is useful for high-speed
computer  links, “deep  sharing”  psychic  rapports,  and  so
forth. Flat +1 point.

Selective:  If  you  have  the  Area  extra,  you  can  choose
which receiver(s) within range get your Communication,
excluding  everyone  else.  This  allows  you  to  go  from  a
single receiver (point-to-point) to all potential receivers in
range (omni-directional) or anywhere in between. +1 cost
per rank.

Subtle:  Your  Communication  cannot  be  “overheard”  (it
is encrypted, scrambled, or otherwise protected). With 2
ranks, your Communication cannot even be detected (that
is,  no  one  can  even  tell  you  are  transmitting,  much  less
what you’re saying). Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Limited:  Communication  may  be  limited  to  only  mem-
bers of a particular group, such as a species, family, mem-
bers  of  an  organization,  and  so  forth. This  is  in  addition
to limitations imposed by medium (that is, requiring sub-
jects to have a means of picking up on the Communica

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Spread throughout this section are boxes like this one,
providing  examples  of  some  of  the  most  common
powers  found  amongst  superhero  characters  to  give
you a “menu” of pre-fabricated powers to choose from
when  creating  your  own  heroes  (and  villains)  in  MU-
MASTERMINDS.  Sample  powers  are  presented  on
the Power Effects table in italics.

Each power is presented in the following format:

NAME

Effect(s): Modifier(s) • Cost

Name: What the power is called. Feel free to mod-
ify the name to suit how you’re using the power.

Effects: The power’s effect or effects are listed by
name.

Modifiers:  Any  modifiers  applying  to  the  effect
are  listed  with  it.  If  a  power  has  multiple  effects,
each is listed with its applicable modifiers.

Cost: Lastly, the power’s cost is given. This is a cost
per rank of the power if it has a ranked effect, oth-
erwise it is a flat cost in power points. Some pow-
ers may have a flat cost for the initial power, plus a
cost per rank for additional ranks.

Effect: Varies, Activation • effects total –1 or 2 points

isting degrees on the target. For example, if you hit a target
and impose a vulnerable condition (one degree), then at-
tack again and get one degree on the effect, you impose
the Affliction’s second degree condition. +1 cost per rank.

Extra  Condition:  Your  Affliction  imposes  an  additional
condition per degree of success. So with one application of
this extra, your Affliction imposes two conditions—such as
dazed  and  hindered,  or  impaired  and  vulnerable—rather
than just one. With two applications, it imposes three con-
ditions,  and  so  forth.  Since  mutually  incompatible  condi-
tions  are  largely  wasted,  Afflictions  with  this  extra  often
have the Limited Degree flaw as well. +1 cost per rank.

Progressive: This modifier causes an Affliction to increase
incrementally  without  any  effort  from  you.  If  the  target
fails  a  resistance  check  to  end  the  Affliction,  it  not  only
persists, but increases in effect by one degree! So a target
affected by the first degree of a Progressive Affliction who
fails to resist progresses to the second degree of the effect
at the start of his next round. A successful resistance check
still ends the Affliction, as usual. +2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Instant Recovery: Similar to the Reversible extra (see p.
196),  the  target  of  an  Affliction  effect  with  this  modifier
recovers  automatically,  no  c

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Perception range effects must accurately perceive a target in order to affect it. This generally means you cannot target
subjects with total concealment from your accurate senses with perception range effects. Thus, foes with Visual Conceal-
ment (the most common accurate sense) can be quite effective against characters relying on perception range attacks,
unless the attacker has an unusual accurate sense to circumvent the Concealment. This is one reason Visual Concealment
costs extra.

At the Gamemaster’s discretion, a successful Perception check to accurately locate a target with an acute sense may al-
low you to use perception range effects on that target; however, the target still benefits from concealment, granting a +5
circumstance bonus to resistance against the effect.

ranks. A plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it
won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions
or answer questions about events outside its immediate
vicinity.

SPIRITS

You can communicate with incorporeal and normally in-
visible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or cer-
tain extradimensional entities, depending on the context
of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as
a “medium” of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what
you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly under-
stood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM’s
discretion,  this  effect  may  extend  to  undead  creatures,
demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the
setting.

FLAWS

Type: You can only comprehend a broad type of subject
(only elves, canines, avians, or sea creatures, for example).
For an additional flaw, you can only comprehend a narrow
type of subject (dogs, falcons, or dolphins, for example).
Broad –1 cost per rank. Narrow –2 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You gain total concealment from a particular sense while
this  effect  is  active,  although  you  are  still  detectable  to
other senses (even other senses of the same sense type;
so you could have full concealment against normal sight,
but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense
type).  Each  additional  rank  gives  you  concealment  from
another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an en-
tire sense type. See Concealment on page 244 for the full
effects.

Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for

1-4 RANKS

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  broken  down  into
sense types, used as descriptors for sensory effects. Here
are  the  traits  of  normal  human  senses,  for  use  when
modifying them with the options from Senses:

VISUAL

Normal  vision  is  ranged  (with  a  –1/10  feet  modifier),
acute (able to distinguish fine details) and accurate (able
to pinpoint the locations of things).
AUDITORY

Normal hearing is ranged  (with  a –1/10  feet modifier),
acute  (able  to  pick  up  details  like  differences  in  tone),
and radius (able to pick up on sounds coming from any
direction). Normal hearing is not accurate.

OLFACTORY

Normal  human  olfactory  senses,  which  lump  together
smell  and  taste  for  descriptor  purposes,  are  fairly  lim-
ited. Ordinary human olfactory senses are neither acute
nor accurate. The sense of smell is a radius sense, how-
ever, able to pick up on scents coming from any direc-
tion. Its “range” is quite limited, however, effectively only
close, except for especially strong scents.

TACTILE

The normal sense of touch is, by definition, close range.
It is accurate (in that you know the location of anything
you  can  touch)  and  radius  (in  that  you  can  feel  things
from any surface of your body).

MENTAL

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS terms, the “sixth sense” or men-
tal  sense  type  is  fairly  crude  in  normal  humans,  lim-
ited essentially to interactions with the Insight skill and
awareness of mental effects used directly on you. Thus it
is close range and has none of the Sense qualities.

horizon and physical barriers between you and the sub-
ject, unless it also Penetrates Concealment.

1 RANK

You can see in the infrared portion of the spectrum, allow-
ing you to see heat patterns. Darkness does not provide
concealment  for  objects  differing  in  temperature  from
their  surroundings.  If  you  have  the Track  effect,  you  can
track warm creatures by the faint heat trails they leave be-
hind. The Gamemaster is the final judge on how long the
trail remains visible.
VISION

1 RANK

You can view extremely small things. You can make Per-
ception checks to see tiny things nearby. Cost is 1 rank for
dust-sized  objects,  2  ranks  for  cellular-sized,  3  ranks  for
DNA and complex molecules, 4 ranks for atomic-sized. The
GM  may  require  an  Expertise  skill  check  to  understand
and interpret what you see.

•

Armor: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addi-
tion to its normal Toughness, possibly including Imper-
vious  Protection.  Some  vehicles  may  have  Sustained
Protection (such as force screens) instead of, or in addi-
tion to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.

Cloaking Device: A vehicle may have a “cloaking de-
vice” granting Concealment from visual senses. Some
vehicles  may  also  have  Concealment  from  auditory
senses or things such as radar, giving them a “stealth
mode.” 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense
type) or 8 points (all visual senses).

Immunity:  Vehicles  normally  provide
immunity
to  the  normal  hazards  of  environments  they  travel
through—such  as  underwater  or  in  space—at  no
additional  cost.  Additional  Immunity  effects  are  for
unusual hazards or circumstances, such as a car that
provides  a  sealed  air  system,  granting  immunity  to
suffocation and other atmospheric hazards.

Smokescreen:  The  vehicle  can  release  a  cloud  of
thick smoke or mist that provides an Area visual Con-
cealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pur-
suers. 12 points.

•  Weapons:  Vehicle  weapons  are  based  on  various
attack  effects,  particularly  Damage  with  various
modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may
mount versions of some of the weapons listed else-
where in this chapter.

A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole
team, particularly useful for shuttling around team mem-

bers  who  cannot  fly  or  move  at  super-speed. The  mem-
bers of the team divide the equipment point cost of the
vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the neces-
sary  ranks  of  the  Equipment  advantage  to  covering  the
vehicle’s cost.

Just like Alternate Equipment, characters may have mul-
tiple  vehicles. These  are  generally  Alternate  Equipment
by  definition,  since  it’s  difficult  to  drive  or  pilot  more
than one vehicle at a time! So the character pays the full
cost  for  the  most  expensive  vehicle,  and  then  1  equip-
ment point for each additional vehicle with the same or
lesser cost.

So a hero with an array of vehicles, such as a plane, boat,
and  car  pays  full  equipment  point  cost  for  the  most  ex-
pensive  of  the  vehicles  and  just  1  equipment  point  for
each  of  the  others.  The  hero’s  player  can  even  spend  a

use  perception  ranged  effects  via  your  Remote  Sensing.
Despite the built-in limitation, this is an extra, since it al-
lows you to use your Remote Sensing to observe subjects
in relative safety. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous:  You  can  use  both  Remote  Sensing  and
your normal senses at the same time, perceiving two lo-
cales like “translucent” overlays of each other. This means
you’re more capable of taking physical action while also
using  your  Remote  Sensing,  although  the  effect  still  re-
quires its normal duration to maintain. You are not vulner-
able while using your Remote Sensing. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle: Remote Sensing already has a degree of subtlety. Ap-
plying 1 rank of Subtle to Remote Sensing increases the DC
to notice the effect to 20 + rank or makes it noticeable only to
a particular unusual sense (with the usual DC 10 + rank per-
ception check). Subtle 2 makes Remote Sensing completely
unnoticeable, as usual. Flat +1 point per rank of Subtle.
FLAWS

Feedback:  With  this  flaw,  damaging  attacks  directed  at
where you displaced your senses can affect you. Your sen-
sory-point is considered to have partial cover from attacks
and you use your Remote Sensing rank as your Toughness
defense against any successful attack. The feedback may
be psychosomatic in nature or due to some sort of disrup-
tion  caused  by  an  assault  on  the  point  where  you  have
redirected your senses. Note that sensory effects already
work on you via Remote Sensing and this flaw doesn’t ap-
ply to them. –1 cost per rank.

Medium: You  require  a  medium  for  your  Remote  Sens-
ing, such as shadows, flames, mirrors, open water, televi-
sion screens, and so forth. You can only perceive locations
where your chosen medium exists. –1 cost per rank.

Noticeable: Remote Sensing with this flaw has an easily
noticeable display, like a glowing set of eyes or a phantom
image of your face, head, or body at the location you are
observing. This manifestation cannot be used for commu-
nication, however (for that, take the Communication ef-
fect). Flat –1 point.

Sense-Dependent:  Remote  Sensing  is  already  Sense-
Dependent  and  cannot  apply  this  flaw.  Another  effect
might potentially have the flaw Remote-Sensing Depen-
dent, such as an Affliction that targets only remote view-
ers observing a target or an area as a means of blocking or

then  invisible  beings  are  visible  to  you.  For  5  ranks,  the

things at range (with the normal –1 per 10 feet modifier to
your Perception check).

1 RANK

When you would normally be surprised in combat, make
a Perception check (DC 10): One degree of success means
you’re  not  surprised,  but  can’t  act  during  the  surprise
round  (so  you  don’t  suffer  any  conditions  of  being  sur-
prised), while two or more degrees of success means you
are not surprised and may act during the surprise round
(if any). Failure means you are surprised (although, if you
have  Uncanny  Dodge,  you  are  not  vulnerable).  The  GM
may raise the DC of the Danger Sense check in some cir-
cumstances. Choose a sense type for your Danger Sense.
Sensory effects targeting that sense also affect your Dan-
ger Sense ability and may “blind” it.

2 RANKS

You can see in complete darkness as if it were normal day-
light;  darkness  provides  no  concealment  to  your  vision.

You always know what direction north lies in and can re-
trace your steps through any place you’ve been.

1 RANK

You can accurately and automatically judge distances.
EXTENDED

1 RANK

You  have  a  sense  that  operates  at  greater  than  normal
range.  Your  range  with  the  sense—the  distance  used
to  determine  penalties  to  your  Perception  check—is  in-
creased by a factor of 10. Each additional time you apply
this option, your range increases by an additional factor
of 10, so 1 rank means you have a –1 to Perception checks
per 100 feet, 2 ranks makes it –1 per 1,000 feet, and so

Items provided by the Equipment advantage (see the Advantages chapter) are essentially effects and other traits with Easily
Removable, along with the various other limitations outlined in the Gadgets & Gear chapter, amounting to a reduction of
–4 points per 5 power points of final cost. Thus the Equipment advantage provides 5 points worth of equipment per rank
(or 1 power point).

ture  to  find  certain  rare  parts,  specialized  help,  or  other
components.

SENSE-DEPENDENT

-1 COST PER RANK

For a flat 1-point reduction in the value of the Removable
flaw, you can define a device as Indestructible. It can still
be taken away, but cannot be damaged or destroyed, ex-
cept as a GM-imposed complication (earning the player a
hero point as usual). This reduction can lower the value of
the flaw to 0, in which case the character gets no power
point discount for the device.

The temporary loss of a removable power does not con-
stitute  a  complication,  any  more  than  the  result  of  any
other  flaw. You  can  have  a  device  or  power-object  as  a
descriptor without this flaw, if you wish, in which case the
power cannot be removed or taken away from you with-
out a complication applied by the GM (earning you a hero
point) or the use of an effect like Nullify, which has pre-
defined conditions for recovery.

-1 COST PER RANK

When applied to an effect that doesn’t normally allow a
resistance  check,  this  flaw  gives  it  one.  Choose  the  de-
fense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on
others  allow  a  resistance  check  by  definition,  this  nearly
always applies to personal effects that allow someone in-
teracting with them to circumvent the effect with a suc-
cessful check.

For  example,  an  Enhanced  Parry  defense  effect  might  re-
flect a low-level reading of a target’s mind to anticipate and
avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome
the effect, denying you the defense bonus against that op-
ponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your
Concealment  effect  might  be  illusory  rather  than  a  true
physical transformation, permitting a Will resistance check
for someone to overcome it. A sustained Protection effect
might be some sort of “kinetic field” that permits an attack-
er a Fortitude resistance check to overcome it.

When applied to an effect that does normally allow a re-
sistance check, this flaw gives it an additional one, which
may be the same as its normal

Example: A spellcaster has Senses 4 (Detect Magic,

13 skill check (10 + 3 additional ranks) to success-
fully cast the spell, followed by the normal Percep-
tion check to pick up on anything present, and per-
haps another Expertise check to interpret what the
character senses.

Skill checks an effect may require include:

Acrobatics: Suitable for effects requiring a measure
of coordination or complex maneuvering.

Deception:  Good  for  effects  intended  to  deceive,
particularly sensory effects like Concealment or Illu-
sion, and disguise or form-altering effects like Morph.

Expertise:  An  Expertise  skill  check  might  represent

LIGHT

You  can  raise  the  light  level  in  the  area,  countering  the
concealment of darkness, but not other forms of conceal-
ment. For 1 point per rank, you can create enough light to
reduce  total  concealment  to  partial  and  partial  conceal-
ment  to  none.  For  2  points  per  rank,  you  can  shed  light
as bright as a sunlit day, eliminating all concealment pro-
vided  by  natural  darkness.  Power  effects  with  the  dark-
ness descriptor may be countered with a successful power
check (see Countering Effects, page 148).

You impose a -2 modifier to Perception checks for 1 point
per rank, and a -5 for 2 points per rank. For more signifi-
cant  obscuring  of  senses  (via  darkness,  fog,  etc.)  use  an
Area Concealment Attack effect (see Concealment in this
chapter).
EXTRAS

Selective: With this extra you can vary the environment
within your affected area, affecting some while not affect-
ing  others,  or  even  mixing  and  matching  different  envi-
ronments (making part of the area cold and another hot,
for example). +1 cost per rank.

GENERAL

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  have  extra  manipulative  limbs,  such  as  arms,  tenta-
cles, or even prehensile hair or a tail. Each rank in this ef-
fect grants you an extra limb.

Extra  Limbs  do  not  allow  you  to  take  additional  actions
in a round, although they do provide the benefits of the
Improved Grab advantage—grabbing with some of your
limbs and leaving others free. All additional limbs except
your dominant limb are considered your “off-hand.” If you
have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you have no
off-hand penalties with any of your limbs.

If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than
taking the option to leave some of them free), you gain a

HOOD: EXTRA LIMBS, NOT EXTRA ACTIONS

As a default, Extra Limbs do not grant characters the abil-
ity to take extra actions in a round, simply because multi-
ple actions—especially extra standard actions usable for
attacks—tend to slow down and unbalance play.

As  an  option  for  including  some  combat  benefits  with
Extra  Limbs,  consider  allowing  the  application  of  the
Multiattack extra to the Strength of a character with Extra
Limbs, reflecting the ability to launch a flurry of attacks
at a single opponent, or to “spread” those attacks among
a number of nearby opponents. See the Multiattack de-
scription under Extras in this

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Although some heroes and villains rely solely on their skills and advantages, most are set apart by their superhuman
powers. MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS characters can lift tanks, fly through the air, throw lightning from their hands, shoot lasers
from their eyes, or any number of other amazing things. This chapter describes these and many other powers and how
you can create your own.

Players spend power points on various powers for their heroes, like acquiring skills or other traits. A power is made up of
one or more effects, possibly with different modifiers, which increase or decrease the cost of the effects.

Effects can be used to create any number of different powers. A hero with the Concealment effect (see page 153) could use
it to create a power called Blending, Blur, Cloak, Invisibility, Shadowmeld, or anything else appropriate to the character you
wish to play. It’s all a matter of how powerful the effect is and what modifiers have been placed on it to increase or decrease
its performance. Another way to think of it is that this book is filled with effects, but your character sheet is filled with powers.

Power  effects  are  acquired  in  ranks,  like  ranks  for  other
traits. The more ranks an effect has, the greater its effect.
Each effect of a power has a standard cost per rank.

MODIFIERS

Modifiers  change  how  an  effect  works,  making  it  more
effective  (an  extra)  or  less  effective  (a  flaw).  Modifiers
have ranks, just like other traits. Extras increase a power’s
cost while flaws decrease it. Some modifiers increase an
effect’s cost per rank, others apply an unchanging cost to
the power’s total; these are called flat modifiers. For more
information see Modifiers, on page 187.

The  final  cost  of  a  power  is  determined  by  base  effect
costs,  modified  by  extras  and  flaws,  multiplied  by  the
power’s rank, with flat modifiers applied to the total cost.

Power Cost = ((base effect costs + extras -
flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers

The rules in this chapter explain what the various powers do,
that is, what their game effects are, but it is left up to the play-
er and Gamemaster to apply descriptors to define exactly
what a power is and what it looks (and sounds, and feels) like
to observers beyond just a collection of game effects.

A power’s descriptors are primarily for color. It’s more inter-
esting and clear to say a hero has a “Flame Blast” or “Light-
ning  Bolt”  power  than  a  gene

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

This section describes the various power effects available in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS. They are listed in alphabetical order.

ATTACK

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Instant • Cost: 1 point per rank

TYPE

You can impose some debilitating condition or conditions
on a target by making a close attack. You set the conditions
your  Affliction  causes  at  each  degree  when  you  acquire  it
and they may not be changed. Higher degree conditions re-
place lower degree conditions and do not stack with them.
See the possible conditions for each degree under the Af-
fliction Resistance Check table. The target resists with For-
titude or Will defense (chosen when you take the effect):

Fortitude or Will vs.
DC [Affliction rank + 10]

Success: No effect.

Failure  (one  degree):  The  target  is  dazed,  entranced,
fatigued,  hindered,  impaired,  or  vulnerable  (choose
one). Potential descriptors include coughing or sneez-
ing,  creeping  mental  influence,  drowsiness,  euphoria,
fear, itchiness, lethargy, nausea, pain, or tipsiness.

Failure (two degrees): The target is compelled, defense-
less,  disabled,  exhausted,  immobile,  prone,  or  stunned
(choose  one).  Potential  descriptors  include  agonizing
pain, confusion, ecstasy, momentary emotional or men-
tal influence, paralysis, seizure, terror, or vomiting.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  asleep,  con-
trolled,  incapacitated,  paralyzed,  transformed  or  un-
aware (choose one).

The target of an Affliction makes a resistance check at the
end of each of his turns to remove first and second degree
conditions. Third  degree  conditions  require  a  minute  of
recovery time or outside aid, such as the Treatment skill or
Healing effect (DC 10 + rank).

The exact nature and descriptors of the Affliction are up
to you, chosen when you acquire the effect, with the GM’s
approval;  some  examples  are  provided,  but  feel  free  to
make up your own.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

EXTRAS

Affects Objects: Weaken with this modifier works on inani-
mate objects, although the effect can still only affect traits
the objects possess. This is most often applied to Weaken
Toughness  for  an  effect  that  can  weaken  both  creatures
and objects. +1 cost per rank, +0 for Affects Only Objects.

Broad: You can Weaken any of a broad set of traits, one at
a time suited to your effects descriptors. So you might be
able to Weaken Abilities, for example, or Weaken Mental
Effects. You choose which trait from the set is weakened
when you use the effect. +1 cost per rank.

Concentration: Once you have hit with a Concentration
Weaken, so long as you continue to take a standard action
each turn to maintain the effect, the target must make a
new resistance check against it, with no attack check re-
quired. +1 cost per rank.

Incurable: Weaken with this modifier cannot have its ef-
fects  countered  by  another  power  (such  as  Restorative
Healing) without the Persistent modifier; the target must
recover from the Weaken normally. Flat +1 point.

MODIFIERS

Precise: A Weaken effect capable of reducing more than one
trait at once can have this modifier, allowing you to choose
which traits are affected, while not affecting others. Note this
differs from the Selective extra (following). Flat +1 point.

Progressive:  A  Progressive  Weaken  effect  reduces  the
affected  traits  each  round  until  the  target  successfully
resists. Make a new resistance check for the target at the
end of each turn; failure weakens the affected trait(s) fur-
ther, while success stops the Progressive Weaken, but the
target must still recover ranks already lost (at the rate of 1
point per turn). +2 cost per rank.

Selective: This extra is applied to an Area Weaken so it only
affects some targets and not others. Combined with Precise
(previously), you can use an Area Weaken to selectively af-
fect only certain traits of certain targets. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous: If applied to a Broad Weaken, this extra al-
lows it to affect all of the traits in its set at the same time.
Each trait loses the difference between the resistance check
result and the DC in power points on a failed check. So a
Simultaneous Weaken Fire Effects subtracts points from ev-
ery fire effect the target possesses with a single attack. The
effect must be Broad to apply this modifier. +1 cost per rank.

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: An artificial intelligence or
magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-
sessed Construct may recall enough of its former life
to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Construct may feel
that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

•

•

Enemy:  The  Construct  could  be  a  rogue  android,
golem,  or  summoned  elemental  hunted  by  its
creator(s)  or  another  person  or  group  who  believes
the Construct is evil for some reason.

FASCINATE

SKILL, RANKED

COMBAT

One of your interaction skills is so effective you can cap-
ture  and  hold  other’s  attention  with  it.  Choose  Decep-
tion,  Intimidation,  or  Persuasion  when  you  acquire  this
advantage. You can also use Fascinate with an appropri-
ate  Expertise  skill,  like  musician  or  singer,  at  the  GM’s
discretion.

You  are  subject  to  the  normal  guidelines  for  interaction
skills, and combat or other immediate danger makes this
advantage  ineffective. Take  a  standard  action  and  make
an  interaction  skill  check  against  your  target’s  opposing
check (Insight or Will defense). If you succeed, the target is
entranced. You can maintain the effect with a standard ac-
tion each round, giving the target a new resistance check.
The effect ends when you stop performing, the target suc-
cessfully resists, or any immediate danger presents itself.
Like all interaction skills, you can use Fascinate on a group,
but  you  must  affect  everyone  in  the  group  in  the  same
way.

You may take this advantage more than once. Each time, it
applies to a different skill.

FAST GRAB

COMBAT

When  you  hit  with  an  unarmed  attack  you  can  immedi-
ately make a grab check against that opponent as a free
action (see Grab, page 248). Your unarmed attack inflicts
its normal damage and counts as the initial attack check
required to grab your opponent.

COMBAT

You  have  an  environment  you’re  especially  suited  for
fighting  in.  Examples  include  in  the  air,  underwater,  in
space, in extreme heat or cold, in jungles or woodlands,
and so forth. While you are in your favored environment,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack checks or your
active defenses. Choose at the start of the round whether
the bonus applies to attack or defense. The choice remains
until the start of your next round. This circumstance bonus
is not affected by power level.

SKILL

You have a particular type of opponent you’ve studied or
are especially effective against. It may be a type of creature
(aliens, animals, constructs, mutants, undead, etc.), a pro-
fession (soldiers, police officers, Yakuza, etc.) or any other
category  the  GM  approves.  Especially  broad  categories
like “humans” or “villains” are not permitted. You gain a +2
circumstance  bonus  on  Deception,  Intimidation,  Insight,
and Perception checks dealing with your Favored Foe. This
circumstance bonus is not limited by power level.

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

RANK 4 - INCORPOREAL

You  can  assume  a  less  solid  form,  with  each  Insubstantial
rank becoming progressively less solid. You do not gain the
ability to assume lower-ranked Insubstantial forms at higher
ranks, but you can acquire a lower-ranked form as an Alter-
nate Effect of a higher-ranked one. You can switch between
normal and Insubstantial form at will as a free action once
per  round.  The  default  is  that  substantial  is  your “normal”
form, but the GM may permit you to make Insubstantial your
“normal” form, in which case remaining solid is a sustained
duration for you! Insubstantial offers four ranks of effect:

You  become  an  incorporeal  phantom.  You  can  pass
through solid matter at your normal speed and you have

you,  as  do  effects  with  the  Affects  Insubstantial  modi-
fier. Choose one other reasonably common effect or de-
scriptor that works on you while you are incorporeal. You
have no effective Strength and cannot affect the physical
world, except with effects with the Affects Corporeal mod-
ifier. Your sensory effects work normally.

RANK 1 - FLUID

You become a fluid mass. You can flow through any sort of
opening,  under  (or  around)  doors,  through  keyholes  and
pipes,  and  so  forth.  You  cannot  pass  through  watertight
seals. You can automatically flow out of any restraint—such
as a snare or grab—that is not watertight. So you cannot flow
out of a bubble completely enclosing you, for example, but
anything  less  cannot  hold  you. You  can  exert  your  normal
Strength and can still push or carry objects, although your
manual dexterity may be limited (at the GM’s discretion).

A  fluid  character  may  attempt  to  catch  a  falling  person
or  object,  cushioning  the  fall  with  the  character’s  flex-
ible  form. This  requires  a  move  action,  and  reduces  the
falling damage by the cushioning character’s Toughness
bonus (representing flexibility in this case). Both charac-
ters  must  make  resistance  checks  against  the  remaining
damage. Higher rank insubstantial forms—lacking physi-
cal Strength—cannot attempt this.

*These numbers are for the Summoner only; for the Du-
plicator,  use  the  totals  listed  for  the  appropriate Twin  or
Triplets, then add the points for the Summon power.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

Supernatural Creatures are fantastical beings out of folk-
tales and scary stories. They’re generally regarded as ur-
