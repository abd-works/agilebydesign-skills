CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

```
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

29

A lot of background details go into making your hero more than just a collection of numbers. Take a moment (if you
haven’t already) to consider some of the following things about your character:

NAME

What is your character’s name? That is to say, what is the
name  the  hero  uses  in  public,  that  appears  in  one-inch
type  in  the  newspaper  headlines?  Most  heroes  adopt
unique  and  distinctive “code  names,”  so  consider  a  suit-
able name for yours. Code names are often based on pow-
ers, theme, or style. Here are some options to consider:
ORIGIN

A name may be based on the hero’s origin, power source,
nation (or even world) of birth, and such.
POWERS

Choose a name based on the hero’s powers: Firestarter or
Blaze for a flame-controlling character, Thunder or Spark
for an electrical character, and so forth.

THEME

Maybe  the  character  has  a  theme  or  style  suggesting  a
name: Paladin might be a medieval knight displaced into
the present day, with a magical sword and armor. Madame
Macabre may be all about magic and the occult.

TITLES

Names  may  include  various  titles  like  Mister,  Miss,  Ms.,
Doctor,  Sir,  Lord,  Lady,  and  Madam  or  even  royal  titles
like  King,  Queen,  Prince,  Princess,  Duke,  Baron,  Emperor
and so forth. Military ranks are also popular parts of hero
names, especially General, Major, and Captain.
GENDER

Names often include gender designations like Man/Wom-
an, Boy/Girl, Lad/Lass, and so forth.
SOUND

Some  code-names  don’t  really  have  anything  to  do  with  a
character’s powers or background—they just sound cool: Kis-
met, Scion, Animus, Damask, and so forth. They may hint at
the hero’s powers or origin, or have nothing to do with them.

REAL NAME

Some heroes go by their given name, not using a code-
name at all. Oftentimes these names still sound like code-

names,  however.  They  may  also  be  nicknames,  such  as
“Dash” for someone with the name Dashell, or “Buzz” for
someone  with  the  name  Buzcinski,  or  whatever  other
nickname a character may have, such as “Stretch” or “Tiny”.

ORIGIN

What’s  the  origin  of  your  hero’s  powers?  It  can  be  any-
thing from a character born with the potential for powers
to someone granted them by an accident—exposure to a
strange meteor, radiation, genetic engineering, or any of
countless similar encounters. Here are some of the more
common superhero origins:
ACCIDENT

Perhaps  the  most  common  origin. The  hero

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Battlesuits  typically  fall  into  one  of  three  categories:
they’re either ranged combatants, melee powerhouses, or
a mix of the two. No matter what role the Battlesuit fills,
the  person  inside  the  armor  tends  to  be  a  fairly  normal
person, possibly highly trained or highly intelligent, who
relies on the armor to provide his or her powers.

### Chunk texts

**Chunk 1** (`1631a649fb6e`):

```
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

79

•

Identity:  The  Paragon  often  hides  his  or  her  true
identity  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Often  the  Para-
gon feels that this “normal” identity keeps him or her
grounded and in touch with the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: The Paragon is motivat-
ed to be a hero because it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  The  Paragon  is  a  patriot
and fights to uphold the ideals of his or her country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Paragon  is  often
motivated  by  the  belief  that  with  power  comes  re-
sponsibility.

•

•

•

Power  Loss:  Usually  caused  by  transforming  back
to a normal human form, some Paragons lack access
to  their  powers  all  the  time.  If  you  choose  this  op-
tion, create a non-powered version of your character
that doesn’t have any of its Powers, has human-level
Abilities, and may even have lower ranks of Skills and
completely different Advantages.

Prejudice:  Some  Paragons  are  appear  inhuman  in
some way and are treated with distrust or fear by the
public.

Relationship:  Paragons  often  have  a  large  number
of  friends,  family,  or  fans  that  get  into  trouble  with
alarming frequency.

•  Weakness: Because the Paragon is so powerful in so
many ways, he or she often suffers from a crippling
weakness to a particular type of attack.

The Powerhouse is the strongest one there is! Where other
archetypes spread their points out amongst a number of
different  powers  and  abilities,  the  Powerhouse  concen-
trates  on  two  things:  strength  and  protection.  In  fights,
the Powerhouse is always on the front line, tearing it up
and,  even  so,  is  usually  the  last  one  standing. The  Pow-
erhouse  is  often  inhuman-looking,  either  because  he  or
she’s been turned into a hulking brute, or is from an alien
world, or is capable of transforming into living stone, steel,
or something equally resistant to damage.
ABILITIES

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Captain  Thunder  has  the  ability  to  hurl
thunderbolts  that  shock  their  targets  with  electric-
ity and deafen them with powerful claps of thunder.
This  is  a  Ranged  Damage  effect  (lightning),  cost-
ing 2 points per rank, Linked to a Ranged Affliction
(deafening thunder), costing 2 points per rank. The
combined effect costs 4 points per rank.Since both
effects  are  ranged  and  require  a  standard  action
to use, so does the combined effect. Since Damage
requires a Toughness check and Affliction requires a
Dodge check, the target checks against them sepa-
rately, making a Toughness resistance check against
the damage of the lightning and a Dodge check to
avoid being deafened by the thunder. Since the two
effects are Linked, Captain Thunder cannot throw a
lightning  bolt  without  the  deafening  thunderclap,
nor can he attempt to merely deafen a target with-
out  also  hitting  them  with  lightning!  (To  do  these
things,  Cap  might  take  the  stand-alone  effects  as
Alternate Effects.)

+1 COST PER RANK

A Multiattack effect allows you to hit multiple targets, or a
single target multiple times, in the same standard action.
Multiattack  can  apply  to  any  effect  requiring  an  attack
check. There are three ways in which a Multiattack effect
can be used:

To  use  a  Multiattack  against  a  single  target,  make  your
attack check normally. If successful, increase the attack’s
resistance check DC by +2 for two degrees of success, and
+5  for  three  or  more. This  circumstance  bonus  does  not
count against power level limits.

If  an  Impervious  Resistance  would  ignore  the  attack  be-
fore any increase in the DC, then the attack still has no ef-
fect as usual; a volley of multiple shots is no more likely to
penetrate Impervious Resistance than just one.

You can use Multiattack to hit multiple targets at once by
“walking” or “spraying” the Multiattack across an arc. Roll
one  attack  check  per  target  in  the  arc. You  suffer  a  pen-
alty to each check equal to the total number of targets. So
making a Multiattack against five targets is a –5 penalty
to each attack check. If you miss one target, you may still
attempt to hit the others.

by  your  covering  attack  at  the  cost  of  being  automati-
cally  attacked  by  it;  make  a  normal  attack  check  to  hit
that opponent.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Perception range effects must accurately perceive a target in order to affect it. This generally means you cannot target
subjects with total concealment from your accurate senses with perception range effects. Thus, foes with Visual Conceal-
ment (the most common accurate sense) can be quite effective against characters relying on perception range attacks,
unless the attacker has an unusual accurate sense to circumvent the Concealment. This is one reason Visual Concealment
costs extra.

At the Gamemaster’s discretion, a successful Perception check to accurately locate a target with an acute sense may al-
low you to use perception range effects on that target; however, the target still benefits from concealment, granting a +5
circumstance bonus to resistance against the effect.

ranks. A plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it
won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions
or answer questions about events outside its immediate
vicinity.

SPIRITS

You can communicate with incorporeal and normally in-
visible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or cer-
tain extradimensional entities, depending on the context
of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as
a “medium” of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what
you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly under-
stood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM’s
discretion,  this  effect  may  extend  to  undead  creatures,
demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the
setting.

FLAWS

Type: You can only comprehend a broad type of subject
(only elves, canines, avians, or sea creatures, for example).
For an additional flaw, you can only comprehend a narrow
type of subject (dogs, falcons, or dolphins, for example).
Broad –1 cost per rank. Narrow –2 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You gain total concealment from a particular sense while
this  effect  is  active,  although  you  are  still  detectable  to
other senses (even other senses of the same sense type;
so you could have full concealment against normal sight,
but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense
type).  Each  additional  rank  gives  you  concealment  from
another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an en-
tire sense type. See Concealment on page 244 for the full
effects.

Concealment from visual senses costs double (2 ranks for
one

suffer any damage from landing after a jump, so long as it
is within your maximum distance.

Continuous:  Extending  the  effect’s  duration  to  continu-
ous allows you to remain Insubstantial until you choose to
return to your corporeal form. +1 cost per rank.

Innate: Use this modifier if your character’s form is natu-
rally  or  innately  Insubstantial,  particularly  if  the  effect  is
permanent in duration. Flat +1 point.

Precise: This modifier allows you to selectively make some
portions of your body insubstantial while keeping others
substantial (or vice versa). This allows you to do things like
reach through a wall, solidify your hand to pick up an ob-
ject  or  tap  someone  on  the  shoulder  (or  punch  them  in
the face), and become incorporeal again to withdraw it on
the following round. Flat +1 point.

Progressive:  You  can  assume  lower  ranked  forms  of  In-
substantial, but you must progress through them in order
to reach the higher-ranked ones. For example if you have
Progressive Insubstantial 3, you can assume fluid, gaseous,
or energy forms, but to assume energy form, you must first
progress through fluid and gaseous, becoming less and less
substantial. Since you can only activate the effect once per
turn, it takes you three turns to get there. +0 cost per rank.

Reaction: Becoming Insubstantial is normally a free action,
meaning  you  can’t  switch  to  an  Insubstantial  form  when
surprised or otherwise unable to take action. At the GM’s
option, applying the Action extra to use Insubstantial as a
reaction allows you to switch forms “reflexively” in response
to such hazards, even if it is not your turn. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle:  This  extra  makes  your  Insubstantial  nature  less
noticeable  to  observers.  Rank  1  requires  a  Perception
check (DC 20) to detect that you are Insubstantial, while 2
ranks mean you look entirely normal in Insubstantial form
(which may cause opponents to waste effort on you, not
knowing  you  are  immune  to  their  attacks,  for  example).
Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Absent Strength: This flaw applies only to rank 1 Insub-
stantial and removes your effective Strength while in that
form, leaving you with limited ability to affect the physical
world like the higher ranks of the effect. Flat –1 point.

Permanent: You are always Insubstantial; you

EXTRAS

Affects Objects: Weaken with this modifier works on inani-
mate objects, although the effect can still only affect traits
the objects possess. This is most often applied to Weaken
Toughness  for  an  effect  that  can  weaken  both  creatures
and objects. +1 cost per rank, +0 for Affects Only Objects.

Broad: You can Weaken any of a broad set of traits, one at
a time suited to your effects descriptors. So you might be
able to Weaken Abilities, for example, or Weaken Mental
Effects. You choose which trait from the set is weakened
when you use the effect. +1 cost per rank.

Concentration: Once you have hit with a Concentration
Weaken, so long as you continue to take a standard action
each turn to maintain the effect, the target must make a
new resistance check against it, with no attack check re-
quired. +1 cost per rank.

Incurable: Weaken with this modifier cannot have its ef-
fects  countered  by  another  power  (such  as  Restorative
Healing) without the Persistent modifier; the target must
recover from the Weaken normally. Flat +1 point.

MODIFIERS

Precise: A Weaken effect capable of reducing more than one
trait at once can have this modifier, allowing you to choose
which traits are affected, while not affecting others. Note this
differs from the Selective extra (following). Flat +1 point.

Progressive:  A  Progressive  Weaken  effect  reduces  the
affected  traits  each  round  until  the  target  successfully
resists. Make a new resistance check for the target at the
end of each turn; failure weakens the affected trait(s) fur-
ther, while success stops the Progressive Weaken, but the
target must still recover ranks already lost (at the rate of 1
point per turn). +2 cost per rank.

Selective: This extra is applied to an Area Weaken so it only
affects some targets and not others. Combined with Precise
(previously), you can use an Area Weaken to selectively af-
fect only certain traits of certain targets. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous: If applied to a Broad Weaken, this extra al-
lows it to affect all of the traits in its set at the same time.
Each trait loses the difference between the resistance check
result and the DC in power points on a failed check. So a
Simultaneous Weaken Fire Effects subtracts points from ev-
ery fire effect the target possesses with a single attack. The
effect must be Broad to apply this modifier. +1 cost per rank.

You can get a general idea of just how good a particu-
lar character’s skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class  guidelines  given  in  The  Basics  along  with  the
rules  for  routine  checks  (see  Routine  Checks  in  that
chapter).

For  example,  a  +5  total  skill  modifier  means  the  char-
acter can routinely achieve a result of 15 (a tough task).
Safe to say the character is a pro, able to routinely han-
dle tasks that would prove too much for someone less
skilled.  A  character  with  a  +10  skill  modifier  achieve  a
DC 20 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of
expertise, while a +15 modifier can routinely complete
DC  25  (formidable)  tasks.  At  the  high  end,  a  +30  skill
modifier  can  routinely  accomplishing  the  nigh  impos-
sible (DC 40 tasks)!

Certain skills, called interaction skills, are aimed at deal-
ing  with  others  through  social  interaction.  Interaction
skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get
them to cooperate with you in one way or another. Since
interaction skills are intended for dealing with others so-
cially, they have certain requirements.

First,  you  must  be  able  to  interact  with  the  subject(s)  of
the  skill. They  must  be  aware  of  you  and  able  to  under-
stand you. If they can’t hear or understand you for some
reason, you have a –5 circumstance penalty to your skill
check (see Circumstance Modifiers in The Basics).

Interaction  skills  work  best  on  intelligent  subjects,  ones
with  an  Intellect  rank  of  –4  or  better. You  can  use  them
on creatures with Int –5, but again with a –5 circumstance
penalty;  they’re  just  too  dumb  to  get  the  subtleties  of
your  point. You  can’t  use  interaction  skills  at  all  on  sub-
jects lacking one or more mental abilities. (Try convincing
a  rock  to  be  your  friend—or  afraid  of  you—sometime.)

If you don’t find a particular skill on the list, like climbing,
bluffing, or search, remember that each skill in MUTANTS &
covers a lot of ground. So, you’ll find climbing
isn’t its own skill, but is listed as part of Athletics, while
bluffing and search are under Deception and Investiga-
tion, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill
you think is most similar to what you’re looking for.

The  Immunity  effect  (see  the  Powers  chapter)  can  also
render characters immune to interaction skills.

You  can  use  interaction  skills  on  groups  of  subjects

Precise: If you can Nullify multiple effects, this modifier al-
lows you to choose which are nullified and which are not.
Flat +1 point.

Randomize: Rather than being countered, the effect(s) tar-
geted by your Nullify acquire the Uncontrolled flaw and go
out of control (as dictated by the GM). +0 cost per rank.

Selective: If you have an Area Nullify effect, this extra al-
lows you to choose who in the area is affected, nullifying
some targets and not others. +1 cost per rank.

Sustained:  If  this  modifier  is  applied  to  Concentration
Nullify, keeping the countered effect(s) suppressed is only
a free action for you each turn. +1 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Side Effect: If you fail to nullify an effect, you might suffer
some kind of “backlash” or similar side effect. –1 cost per
rank.

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

Protection shields you against damage, giving you +1 to
your Toughness  defense  per  rank.  So  Protection  4  gives
you +4 Toughness.

FLAWS

Sustained:  Your  Protection  is  a  sustained  effect,  rather
than permanent. The effect can be turned on and off and
can be improved using extra effort, including using it to
perform  stunts  (see  Extra  Effort).  Sustained  Protection
might be a power like a personal force field, or the ability
to consciously harden your skin and turn it into armor. +0
cost per rank.

QUICKNESS

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  can  perform  routine  tasks—anything  that  can  be
done as a routine check (see Routine Checks in The Ba-
sics  chapter)—fast,  perhaps  very  fast.  Subtract  your  ef-
fect rank from the normal time rank to perform a task to
determine how long it takes you. So, for example, if you
have Quickness 7, a routine task normally taking an hour
(time rank 9) takes you (9 – 7 = time rank 2) 30 seconds.
Non-routine checks are not affected by Quickness, nor is
movement speed.

If you can perform a task in less than a second (time rank
–2), the GM may choose to treat that task as a free action
for you (although the GM can still limit the number of free
actions you can accomplish in a turn as usual).

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  The  villain  Doctor  Shock  can  create  an
aura  of  electricity  around  his  body,  damaging  any-
one  or  anything  touching  him.  This  is  a  Reaction
Damage effect, causing Damage when Doctor Shock
is touched. Of course, Doctor Shock’s aura zaps any-
one  or  anything  touching  him,  including  his  allies!
The only way he can prevent this is to turn the aura
off  altogether.  If  Doctor  Shock  possessed  the  ability
to have his aura only damage people and things he
wants it to damage, he would need to have the Selec-
tive modifier applied to the effect as well.

The Reaction modifier applies +1 cost per rank to effects
with  a  default  action  of  free,  +3  cost  per  rank  to  effects
with a default standard action.

FLAT • 1 POINT

You can remove conditions caused by a Reversible effect at
will as a free action, so long as the subject is within the ef-
fect’s range. Examples include removing the damage condi-
tions caused by a Damage effect, repairing damage done by
Weaken Toughness, or removing an Affliction instantly. Nor-
mally, you have no control over the results of such effects.

RICOCHET

FLAT • 1 POINT PER RANK

You  can  ricochet  or  bounce  an  attack  effect  with  this
modifier off of a solid surface to change its direction. This
allows you to attack around corners, overcome cover and
possibly  make  a  surprise  attack  against  an  opponent.  It
does not allow you to affect multiple targets. The “bounce”
has no effect apart from changing the attack’s direction.
You  must  be  able  to  define  a  clear  path  for  your  attack,
which must follow a straight line between each ricochet.
Each  rank  in  Ricochet  allows  you  to  bounce  the  attack
once before it hits. Ricochet may grant a bonus to hit due
to surprise, at the GM’s discretion.

+1 COST PER RANK

An  instant  duration  effect  with  this  modifier  affects  the
target  once  immediately  (when  the  effect  is  used)  and
then  once  again  on  the  following  round,  at  the  end  of
the attacker’s turn. The target gets the normal resistance
check against the secondary effect.

Secondary Effects don’t stack, so if you attack a target with
your Secondary Effect on the round after a successful hit,
it doesn’t affect the target twice; it simply delays the sec-
ond  effect  for  another  round. You  can  attack  the  target
with a different effect, however. So, for example, if you hit
a target with a Secondary Damage Effect then, o

manoids, animals, machines, and so forth. At rank 4 you
can assume any form of the same mass as your own.

For the ability to change size as well as appearance see the
Growth and Shrinking effects. To take on the other traits of
forms you assume, see the Metamorph extra, following, or
the Variable effect, later in this chapter.
EXTRAS

Attack:  A  Morph  Attack  imposes  a  different  appearance
on  the  target  creature.  Unlike  an  Affliction  that  imposes
the transformed condition, a Morph Attack is entirely cos-
metic: you can’t change the target’s traits other than ap-
pearance. +0 cost per rank.

Metamorph:  Morph  only  changes  your  appearance;  you
still  have  all  the  traits  of  your  normal  form. This  modifier
allows  you  to  have  an  alternate  set  of  traits,  essentially  a
complete  alternate  character  you  change  into,  one  set  of
traits per rank in Metamorph. You can switch between sets
of traits at will, once per round, as a free action. Your other
form(s) must have the same point total as you and are sub-
ject  to  the  same  power  level  limits. They  must  also  have
traits  suitable  to  your  Morph  effect.  For  example,  if  you
can only Morph into humanoid forms, then your alternate
forms all have to be humanoid. All of your forms must have
your full Morph effect as well; those power points cannot
be reallocated. The GM may require certain additional com-
mon traits for all of your forms, particularly mental abilities
and skills, if you retain them. Metamorph is best suited to
characters with defined sets of alternate traits. For a char-
acter able to transform into a virtually unlimited number of
forms with various traits, see the Variable effect later in this
chapter. Flat +1 point per rank of Metamorph.
FLAWS

Resistible: A Morph effect Resistible by Will is most likely
a mental illusion of some sort. Observers who succeed on
the Will  resistance  check  see  you  as  you  truly  are  rather
than in your Morph guise. This is in addition to the usual
Perception check to penetrate your disguise. If you have
the Metamorph extra, then targets that resist your effect
treat you as if you had your normal traits, and not those
granted by your Metamorph form. –1 cost per rank.

CREATE

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while Sum-
mon  conjures  creatures  of  some  sort,  capable  of  inde-
pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless
creatures  like  ro

move  one  of  the  following  conditions  from  an  ally  with
whom you can interact: dazed, fatigued, or stunned.

LUCK

FORTUNE, RANKED (1/2 PL)

Once per round, you can choose to re-roll a die roll, like
spending a hero point (see Hero Points, page 20), includ-
ing adding 10 to re-rolls of 10 or less. You can do this a
number  of  times  per  game  session  equal  to  your  Luck
rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level
(rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero
points “reset”  at  the  start  of  an  adventure. The  GM  may
choose to set a different limit on ranks in this advantage,
depending on the series.

Generally speaking, languages are not terribly important
in comic book superhero stories except as background col-
or or occasional plot complications. Gamemasters should
allow  players  with  characters  fluent  in  other  languages
the occasional opportunity to show them off or put them
to good use. If you specifically set up the language barrier
as an obstacle by confronting the heroes with a language
they cannot possibly understand, that should count as a
complication and be worth a hero point.

COMBAT

MINION

GENERAL, RANKED

You can draw a weapon from a holster or sheath as a free
action, rather than a move action.

You have a follower or minion. This minion is an indepen-
dent  character  with  a  power  point  total  of  (advantage
rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level
limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions
(if capable of independent thought) automatically have a
helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the nor-
mal rules for minions (see page 245).

Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend
earned  power  points  to  increase  your  rank  in  this  advan-
tage to improve the minion’s power point total and traits.
Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are
replaced in between adventures with other followers with
similar abilities at the Gamemaster’s discretion.

ACTION

COMBAT

When taking a standard action and a move action you can
move both before and after your standard action, provid-
ed the total distance moved isn’t greater than your normal
movement speed.

COMBAT

When  you  make  a  power  attack  (see  Maneuvers,  page
250)  you  can  take  a  penalty  of  up  to  –5  on  your  attack
bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to the effect
bonus of your attack.

tion effect). This is the base sense of the radio sense type.
It’s ranged, radius, and acute by default.

RADIUS

1-2 RANKS

You can make Perception checks with a radius sense for
any  point  around  you.  Subjects  behind  you  cannot  use
Stealth  to  hide  from  you  without  some  other  conceal-
ment. Auditory, olfactory, and tactile senses are normally
radius for humans. Cost is 1 rank for use with one sense, 2
ranks for one sense type.
RANGED

1 RANK

You can use a sense that normally has no range (taste or
touch  in  humans)  to  make  Perception  checks  at  range,
with the normal –1 per 10 feet modifier. This can be en-
hanced with the Extended Sense effect.

RAPID

1 RANK

You can read or take in information from a sense faster than
normal:  each  rank  increases  your  perception  speed  by  a
factor of 10 (x10, x100, etc.) with a single sense, double cost
for an entire sense type. You can use rapid vision to speed-
read, pick up on rapid flickering between frames of a film,
watch video replays in fast-forward speeds, and such, rapid
hearing to listen to time-compressed audio “blips,” and so
forth.

1 RANK

Precognition  and  Postcognition  can  be  problematic
abilities,  since  they  provide  players  with  considerable
information. Keep in mind precognitive and postcogni-
tive information is often cryptic or unclear, and changes
in circumstances may lead to changes in visions of the
future. If players use either too often, feel free to have
their visions become less and less clear as the timelines
become tangled by so much constant surveillance and
intervention.

Generally, Precognition is best treated as a plot device
for the GM to provide information to the player as suits
the  adventure,  similar  to  a  free  use  of  the  inspiration
ability of hero points. In fact, GMs looking to limit Pre-
cognition and Postcognition may wish to require extra
effort or hero points to use them, or require the Uncon-
trolled modifier.

one in an area. Apply the Selective modifier for the abil-
ity to choose who in the area does and does not benefit
from the Senses. To affect the area of a sense itself, use
the Extended and Radius  traits of the Senses  effect. +1
cost per rank.

Dimensional:  This  modifier  allows  you  to  extend  your
senses  into  other  dimensions.  It’s  assumed  to  apply  to
all your senses, allowing you to sense your proximate lo-

A construct can buy up one of its nonexistent ability ranks
by spending power points; +1 rank per 2 power points, as
usual, but starting at a rank of –5. This gives the construct
the normal use of that ability. Note a construct with Intel-
lect  but  no  Presence  is  intelligent  but  non-sentient  (not
self-aware) and a construct needs a rank in both Strength
and  Agility  to  be  able  to  move  and  act  physically.  Con-
structs cannot buy Stamina, since creatures with Stamina
are, by definition, not constructs.

Like inanimate objects, constructs have a Toughness rank,
which measures their ability to resist damage. A construct
starts out at Toughness 0 and can increase its rank using
the Protection effect. A mobile construct can even have
the Defensive Roll advantage.

SKILLS

Constructs can have skills just like characters at the same
cost.  However,  constructs  cannot  have  skills  based  on
abilities they lack.

Constructs can have advantages at the same cost as other
characters. Some advantages are less useful or even use-

less to constructs and, like skills, constructs cannot have
advantages requiring abilities they lack.
POWERS

Constructs can have various power effects, like other char-
acters. Some effects are less useful or even useless to con-
structs  and  the  GM  has  final  say  as  to  whether  or  not  a
particular effect can be assigned to a construct. Power ef-
fects are often aspects of a construct’s makeup or design,
such as built-in armor (Protection), weapons (Damage), or
sensors (Sense).

SIZE

Constructs larger or smaller than medium must pay pow-
er points for Innate and Permanent Growth or Shrinking.

A construct’s owner can give it orders verbally or through
any other means the construct understands. Command-
ing a construct is a move action. Constructs follow orders
to the best of their ability. Non-intelligent constructs do
exactly  as  they’re  told,  without  creativity  or  initiative,
while  intelligent  constructs  have  the  ability  to  interpret
and improvise. An owner can also give a construct a series
of basic orders for it to fulfill, such as “stay and guard this
place and attack anyon

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

•

Identity:  The  Paragon  often  hides  his  or  her  true
identity  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Often  the  Para-
gon feels that this “normal” identity keeps him or her
grounded and in touch with the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: The Paragon is motivat-
ed to be a hero because it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  The  Paragon  is  a  patriot
and fights to uphold the ideals of his or her country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Paragon  is  often
motivated  by  the  belief  that  with  power  comes  re-
sponsibility.

•

•

•

Power  Loss:  Usually  caused  by  transforming  back
to a normal human form, some Paragons lack access
to  their  powers  all  the  time.  If  you  choose  this  op-
tion, create a non-powered version of your character
that doesn’t have any of its Powers, has human-level
Abilities, and may even have lower ranks of Skills and
completely different Advantages.

Prejudice:  Some  Paragons  are  appear  inhuman  in
some way and are treated with distrust or fear by the
public.

Relationship:  Paragons  often  have  a  large  number
of  friends,  family,  or  fans  that  get  into  trouble  with
alarming frequency.

•  Weakness: Because the Paragon is so powerful in so
many ways, he or she often suffers from a crippling
weakness to a particular type of attack.

The Powerhouse is the strongest one there is! Where other
archetypes spread their points out amongst a number of
different  powers  and  abilities,  the  Powerhouse  concen-
trates  on  two  things:  strength  and  protection.  In  fights,
the Powerhouse is always on the front line, tearing it up
and,  even  so,  is  usually  the  last  one  standing. The  Pow-
erhouse  is  often  inhuman-looking,  either  because  he  or
she’s been turned into a hulking brute, or is from an alien
world, or is capable of transforming into living stone, steel,
or something equally resistant to damage.

they’re either ranged combatants, melee powerhouses, or
a mix of the two. No matter what role the Battlesuit fills,

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

107

Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.

STRENGTH (STR)

INTELLECT (INT)

Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to
apply it. Your Strength rank applies to:

•

Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based
attacks.
How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).
The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.
Athletics skill checks.

•
•
•
STAMINA (STA)

Stamina  is  health,  endurance,  and  overall  physical  resil-
ience.  Stamina  is  important  because  it  affects  a  charac-
ter’s ability to resist most forms of damage. Your Stamina
modifier applies to:

•
•

•

Toughness defense, for resisting damage.
Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your
character’s health.
Stamina  checks  to  resist  or  recover  from  things  af-
fecting  your  character’s  health  when  a  specific  de-
fense doesn’t apply.

AGILITY (AGL)

Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coor-
dination. Your Agility rank applies to:

•

•
•
•

Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and oth-
er hazards.
Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.
Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.
Agility  checks  for  feats  of  coordination,  gross  move-
ment, and quickness when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

DEXTERITY (DEX)

Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  hand-eye  coordination,  preci-
sion, and manual dexterity. Your Dexterity rank applies to:

•
•
•

Attack checks for ranged attacks.
Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.
Dexterity  checks  for  feats  of  fine  control  and  preci-
sion when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

FIGHTING (FGT)

Fighting  measures  your  character’s  ability  in  close  com-
bat, from hitting a target to ducking and weaving around
any counter-attacks. Your Fighting rank applies to:

•
•

Attack checks for close attacks.
Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.

Intellect covers reasoning ability and learning. A character
with a high Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and
well-educated. Your Intellect modifier applies to:

•

•

Expertise,  Investigation, Technology,  and Treatment
skill checks.
Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-
power when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

AWARENESS (AWE)

While  Intellect  covers  reasoning,  Awareness  describes
common sense and intuition, what some might call “wis-
dom.” A character with a high Intellect and a low Aware-
ness may be an “absent-minded professor” type, smart

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

provides a framework for your imagination. It has rules to help determine what happens in your
stories and to resolve conflicts between characters and the challenges they face. With it, you can experience adventure
as a hero fighting against the forces of evil! Any adventure you can imagine is possible.

Like all games, MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS has rules. This chapter looks at the basic rules of the game and how they work,
giving you the foundation upon which the rest of the game is built.

uses a standard, or “core,” game me-
chanic to resolve actions. Whenever a character attempts
an action with a chance of failure, do the following:

•

•

•

Roll a twenty-sided die (or d20).

Add any relevant modifiers (for game traits like abili-
ties, skills, powers, or circumstances) to the number
rolled.

Compare  the  total  to  a  number  called  a  difficulty
class (abbreviated DC).

If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class (set by the
GM  based  on  the  circumstances),  the  effort  succeeds.  If
the result is lower than the difficulty class, it fails.

This simple mechanic is used for nearly everything in MU-
MASTERMINDS, with variations based on what modi-
fiers are made to the roll, what determines the difficulty
class, and the exact degree of success and failure. Remem-
ber...

d20 + modifiers vs. difficulty class

... and you understand how to play most of the game!

One of the players in a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game takes
the  role  of  Gamemaster  (abbreviated  GM).  The  Game-
master is responsible for running the game—a combina-
tion  of  writer,  director,  and  referee.  The  GM  creates  the
adventures for the heroes, portrays the villains and sup-
porting characters, describes the world to the players, and
decides the outcome of the heroes’ actions based on the
roll of the die and the guidelines given in the rules. It’s a
big  job,  but  also  a  rewarding  one,  since  the  Gamemas-
ter gets to develop the world and all the characters in it,
along with inventing fun and exciting stories.

If  you’re  going  to  be  the  Gamemaster,  you  should  read
through this whole book carefully. You should have a firm
grasp of the rules, since you’re expected to interpret them
for the players to help decide what happens in the game.
You’ll  also  help  the  players  develop  their  own  heroes,
making sure they fit into the world and have potential for
exciting stories in their own right.

tact and friendship. These relationships are very im-

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

•  Motivation—Doing Good: Some Shapeshifters are

heroes because it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Recognition: Shapeshifters sometimes
become heroes in order to receive praise or fame.

•  Motivation—Thrills: Many Shapeshifters become he-
roes because they enjoy the action and adventure... and
their powers often keep them from any lasting injury.

•

Relationships:  Shapeshifters  often  have  close
friends and family around them.

SPEEDSTER

Speedsters can move great distances in little or no time.
They  do  this  either  by  running  or  flying  at  superhuman
speeds, or by instantly transporting themselves from one
place to another. Because of their great speed, Speedsters
seldom need ranged powers. Speedsters are also able to
use their movement mode to break the laws of physics in
ways even other fast superheroes are incapable of doing.

ABILITIES

MYSTIC

The  Mystic  commands  vast  magical  powers  and  uses
them  to  defend  the  Earth  from  otherworldly  threats  as
well  as  to  combat  the  evils  found  just  down  the  street.
The  Mystic  typically  has  extensive  knowledge  of  magic
and other realms, but few real-world skills to speak of. The
magical powers the Mystic commands are nearly limitless,
allowing  the  Mystic  to  fire  blasts  of  magical  energy,  fly,
create  illusions,  heal  others,  travel  to  other  dimensions,
and reproduce virtually any other power imaginable.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  Some  Psychics  use
their powers for good, because they feel they must
have been given their powers to help others.

•

Power  Loss:  Because  mental  powers  often  require
some  amount  of  focus;  drugs,  disorientation  of  any

may  pick  up  personality  traits  and  attitudes  from
people they’ve interacted with using their powers.

Shapeshifters include characters who actually change their

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: An artificial intelligence or
magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-
sessed Construct may recall enough of its former life
to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Construct may feel
that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

•

•

Enemy:  The  Construct  could  be  a  rogue  android,
golem,  or  summoned  elemental  hunted  by  its
creator(s)  or  another  person  or  group  who  believes
the Construct is evil for some reason.

•

Accident:  The  Mystic  commands  incredible  super-
natural powers, but sometimes those powers get out
of control, or awaken sleeping horrors, or cause other
unintended consequences that have to be dealt with.

Enemy: Some Mystics are plagued by enemies who
want to displace them or steal their power.

Honor:  It’s  not  uncommon  for  a  Mystic  to  follow  a
code of conduct that keeps them on the straight and
narrow,  perhaps  because  it’s  the  right  thing  to  do,
perhaps because they need to in order to keep their
powers in check.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Mystics  are  often  either
not from Earth or were trained in the mystic arts on
another  world. When  they  come  to  this  plane  they
use their talents to help others and hopefully earn a
place for themselves on their adopted world.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Mystic was given
his  or  her  power  for  a  reason—to  defend  Earth,  to
hunt down otherworldly creatures, or any number of
other options. Or perhaps the Mystic recognizes that
his or her power comes with a price.

•

•

Power  Loss:  Mystics  often  have  the  Complication
that  prevents  them  from  using  their  powers  when
they can’t move and/or speak to cast their spells.

Prejudice: Some Mystics are surrounded by an aura
of “otherness”  that  sets  them  apart  from  the  rest  of
humanity and makes it difficult for them to interact
with others. Or, maybe people just fear witches.

PARAGON

Paragons are what people first think of when they think
of superheroes. A Paragon is nearly perfect in every way:
fast, strong, tough, often has the ability to fly, and repre-
sents everything good about humanity. Paragons are of-
ten talented in a wide range of areas and easily take on
leadership roles.

Man of Action: You’re the height of human
perfection, whether through a lifetime of
experimental training or due to influence from some
outside source.

human who’s gained incredible abilities.

some other supernatural force.

mankind, he or she may also become a hero for the
same reason.

•  Motivation—Recognition:  Some  Gadgeteers  want
their genius recognized not just by other  scientists,
but by millions of adoring fans.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Gadgeteer  often
feels it’s only right to use his or her incredible intel-
ligence to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Gadgeteers  love  to  push  the
limit and live on the edge of scientific research, so it
only makes sense that they might like dressing up in
tights and taking on the role of a hero.

•

•

Quirk—Psychological Problems: Perhaps the Gad-
geteer’s  devices  have  slowly  been  poisoning  his
or  her  mind,  or  biofeedback  caused  by  improperly
functioning cybernetics or other mechanical systems
have  caused  the  Gadgeteer  to  exhibit  some  sort  of
mental problem.

Relationship:  Gadgeteers  often  have  a  number  of
important  people  in  their  life,  either  family,  loved
ones, other researchers, or employees who like to get
into trouble.

The Martial Artist has honed his skills in unarmed combat
to  bridge  the  physical  gap  between  him  and  his  super-
powered  associates.  In  fact,  some  Martial  Artists  display
feats  that  seem  impossible  by  normal  standards—and
may have a mystical origin.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

•

•

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

Supernatural Creatures are fantastical beings out of folk-
tales and scary stories. They’re generally regarded as ur-

with no Stamina are often—but not necessarily—im-

chapter). They have no Fortitude defense.

they are alive).

•

Presence: Creatures without Presence are unable to
interact and immune to interaction skills. They have
no Will defense.

Lacking an ability is –10 power points; that is, it gives the
character  an  additional  10  power  points  to  spend  else-
where,  similar  to  having  a  –5  rank  in  an  ability,  but  with
different  effects.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  heroes  cannot  be
absent an ability without Gamemaster permission, as it can
have significant effects on the character and the game.

Fighting: A creature with no Fighting is incapable of
making any sort of close attack (but may still be able
to launch ranged attacks, if it has Dexterity).

Absent abilities cannot be weakened (see the Weaken ef-
fect in the Powers chapter) or debilitated, since they are
not present at all in the first place!

Intellect: A creature with no Intellect is an automa-
ton, lacking free will and operating entirely on simple
instinct  or  pre-programmed  instructions.  Anything
with no Intellect is immune to mental effects and in-
teraction skills and has no Will defense.

Awareness:  Anything  with  no  Awareness  is  com-
pletely unaware and also has no Presence. It is an in-
animate object, not a creature. Objects are immune
to mental effects and interaction skills, and have no

Inanimate  objects  have  no  abilities  other  than  their
Toughness. Animate, but nonliving, constructs such as ro-
bots or zombies have Strength, Agility, and Dexterity, and
may  have  ranks  of  Awareness  and  Presence  (if  aware  of
their environment or capable of interaction), and Fighting
(if able to make close attacks). They may have Intellect (if
capable  of  independent  thought),  but  have  no  Stamina
(since  they  are  not  living  things).  See  Constructs  in  the
Gadgets & Gear chapter for more information.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES
CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

Over  the  course  of  play,  your  hero’s  ability  ranks  may
change for the following reasons:

•

•

Some power effects raise or lower ability ranks (see
the Powers chapter).

You can improve ability ranks permanently by spend-
ing  earned  power  points  on  them,  but  you  cannot
increase  an  ability  rank  above  the  limits  set  by  the
series’ power level (see Power Level, page 24).

Whenever  an  ability  rank  changes,  all  traits  associated
with  the  ability  change  as  well.  So  if  you  increase  your
character’s Agility, his Agility-based skills and Dodge de-
fense  also  increase.  Likewise,  if  the  hero’s  Agility  bonus
decreases, his Agility-based skills and Dodge suffer.

If one of your hero’s ability ranks drops below –5 for any
reason, that ability is said to be debilitated and the char-
acter  suffers  more  serious  effects  than  just  a  penalty  to
certain traits and rolls, as follows:

•

•

•

•

Debilitated  Strength,  Agility,  or  Dexterity  means
the  hero  collapses:  defenseless,  immobilized,  and
stunned (although still conscious and aware).

Debilitated  Stamina  means  the  hero  is  dying,  and
suffers  a  –5  modifier  on  Fortitude  checks  to  avoid
death on top of it.

Debilitated  Fighting  means  the  hero  is  dazed  and
defenseless, and cannot make close attacks.

Debilitated
Intellect,  Awareness,  or  Presence
means the hero is unaware and remains so until re-
stored to at least a –5 rank in the ability.

Debilitated  ability  ranks  usually  result  from  a  power  af-
fecting  your  character.  Ability  ranks  cannot  be  lowered
any further once they are debilitated.

Rather  than  having  a  rank  of  –5  in  a  given  ability,  some
things  or  creatures  actually  lack  an  ability  altogether.
These  beings  automatically  fail  any  check  requiring  the
absent ability. The additional effects of  an  absent ability
are as follows:

•

•

Strength:  A  creature  with  no  Strength  is  incapable
of exerting any physical force, either because it has
no physical form (like an incorporeal ghost) or simply
can’t move (like a tree).

Stamina: A creature with no Stamina has no physical
body (like a ghost) or is not a living being (such as a
robot or other construct). Creatures with no Stamina
suffer  and  recover  from  damage  like  inanimate  ob-
jects  (see  Damaging  Objects  under  the  Damage

a particular animal. The Totem may have acquired its pow-
ers  through  an  accident  of  science,  an  invocation  of  the

animal. Totem heroes tend to be as varied as the animals
they represent, and they can resemble other archetypes

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

BYSTANDER

Scientists are specialists in their chosen field. This arche-
type  can  be  used  as  anything  from  an  archaeologist  to
zoologist, or for anything with a lot of knowledge about a
particular subject, such as a professor.

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through
the ranks and now run the show. Physically a crime lord
is  no  match  for  a  hero,  but  their  connections,  resources,
and  knowledge  of  the  underworld  can  be  problematic.
The crime lord presented here is a fairly small fish; Game-
masters should make any changes needed to increase the
crime lord’s power and influence for the series.

of what the series is about, what sort of characters are suit-
ed to it, and some ideas to get you going.

LEGACIES

Power Level: 8–10 • Scale: Local
Setting: Modern • Style: Grayscale

You’ve  known  each  other  all  your  lives,  played  together
as  kids,  were  always  visiting  each  other’s  homes  with
your  parents,  and  had  pretty  good  lives  together.  Now
you’ve discovered each of you has... exceptional abilities
and have decided, either independently, or as a group, to
become heroes! Do you have what it takes to work as a
team? What do you do when all of your parents disappear
at the same time? How do you deal with learning they’re
actually longtime heroes... or villains?

HEROES

Power Level: 7–9 • Scale: Regional
Setting: Historical • Style: Light

Power Level: 10–12 • Scale: Global
Setting: Modern • Style: Grayscale

The  local  big-league  super-team  has  disbanded;  they
might even be missing and presumed dead after another
titanic battle to save the city. But the city needs its heroes,
so it’s up to a new group of heroes to take up the mantle
and the responsibility to defend the city from threats too
great for any one of them to handle. Rebuilding the team
is no small task, nor is winning the trust of the city, and
you can bet the old team’s foes will waste no time in tak-
ing advantage of the situation. Do your heroes have what
it  takes  to  create  a  team  of  their  own? What  happens  if
they do and the previous team returns?

Power Level: 12-15 • Scale: Multiversal
Setting: The multiverse • Style: Grayscale

America is threatened by the growing threat of the Axis
powers. President Roosevelt sends a number of the well-
known  heroes  across  the  globe  to  save  American  sol-
diers and perform special operations. Wisely, he also asks
a  number  of  rookie  heroes  to  handle  some  important
jobs, on the home-front and abroad, but also behind the
scenes. Does your two-fisted hero have the guts to pass
up the glory of answering the President’s call to serve a
higher cause?

In the wake of multiversal threats, including the machi-
nations of powerful extradimensional beings, a mysteri-
ous organization has instituted a program of recruiting
agents  from  across  the  various  worlds.  They  take  only
the  most  capable,  forming  a  powerful  alliance  to  pro-
tect the multiverse from terrible threats and keep their
timeline untangled. The characters come from many al-
terna

```
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

29

A lot of background details go into making your hero more than just a collection of numbers. Take a moment (if you
haven’t already) to consider some of the following things about your character:

NAME

What is your character’s name? That is to say, what is the
name  the  hero  uses  in  public,  that  appears  in  one-inch
type  in  the  newspaper  headlines?  Most  heroes  adopt
unique  and  distinctive “code  names,”  so  consider  a  suit-
able name for yours. Code names are often based on pow-
ers, theme, or style. Here are some options to consider:
ORIGIN

A name may be based on the hero’s origin, power source,
nation (or even world) of birth, and such.
POWERS

Choose a name based on the hero’s powers: Firestarter or
Blaze for a flame-controlling character, Thunder or Spark
for an electrical character, and so forth.

THEME

Maybe  the  character  has  a  theme  or  style  suggesting  a
name: Paladin might be a medieval knight displaced into
the present day, with a magical sword and armor. Madame
Macabre may be all about magic and the occult.

TITLES

Names  may  include  various  titles  like  Mister,  Miss,  Ms.,
Doctor,  Sir,  Lord,  Lady,  and  Madam  or  even  royal  titles
like  King,  Queen,  Prince,  Princess,  Duke,  Baron,  Emperor
and so forth. Military ranks are also popular parts of hero
names, especially General, Major, and Captain.
GENDER

Names often include gender designations like Man/Wom-
an, Boy/Girl, Lad/Lass, and so forth.
SOUND

Some  code-names  don’t  really  have  anything  to  do  with  a
character’s powers or background—they just sound cool: Kis-
met, Scion, Animus, Damask, and so forth. They may hint at
the hero’s powers or origin, or have nothing to do with them.

REAL NAME

Some heroes go by their given name, not using a code-
name at all. Oftentimes these names still sound like code-

names,  however.  They  may  also  be  nicknames,  such  as
“Dash” for someone with the name Dashell, or “Buzz” for
someone  with  the  name  Buzcinski,  or  whatever  other
nickname a character may have, such as “Stretch” or “Tiny”.

ORIGIN

What’s  the  origin  of  your  hero’s  powers?  It  can  be  any-
thing from a character born with the potential for powers
to someone granted them by an accident—exposure to a
strange meteor, radiation, genetic engineering, or any of
countless similar encounters. Here are some of the more
common superhero origins:
ACCIDENT

Perhaps  the  most  common  origin. The  hero

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

Now the remaining smugglers get to go. They draw their guns and shoot at you!

The GM rolls attack checks against the heroes. Two smugglers shoot at Ultramarine and three shoot at Princess, but they both
have Impervious Toughness 8. Since the smugglers’ guns can’t hurt them, the GM does not bother rolling the attack checks. The
remaining two shoot at Rook, but one is impaired and the other blind, so they both miss by a mile.

Rook, you easily avoid the clumsy shots, especially from the guys dazzled by the flash bomb. Princess, Ultramarine, a
couple of stray shots ricochet off of you harmlessly.
ROUND 2

That brings us back to the top of the order. Princess?

Princess: I’m going to punch-out one of the smugglers! “Hey, watch the couture, boys!”

GM: Roll an unarmed attack check.

Princess: Rolls, gets a natural 20. A critical hit!

GM: Glances at Princess’ Strength of 12, and the +5 critical hit DC modifier, making the Toughness resistance DC (15 + 12 + 5)
or 32. No way the smuggler can succeed.

Wow! You send the guy flying right off the deck and into the drink! Sploosh!

Then, suddenly…

The GM rolls an attack check against Princess, getting a 15 result. Normally this would miss her Dodge defense of 18, but this is
a surprise attack, so Princess is vulnerable and her Dodge is halved to 4, rather than 8, making the DC a 14.

…a steel mesh net launches out of the doorway of the control cabin of the ship. Princess, give me a Dodge resistance
check.

Princess: Rolls a 5 for a total of 13. Um… 13?

GM: Compares it against the DC of 19. Two degrees of failure.

…the net wraps around you tightly, leaving you immobilized and defenseless, Princess.

From out of the control cabin lumbers a massive armored figure in red and silver, one arm ending in a lobster-like servo-
claw.

Ultramarine: Trawler!

GM: In Trawler’s voice. Who did you think was running this operation, heroes? Now back off!

Ultramarine: Is it my turn?

GM: No. It would be, but you delayed until after Rook, remember? Rook, it’s your turn, then Ultramarine and the smug-
glers.

Rook: I don’t think my weapons will do much against Trawler’s armor. Can I help Princess get free from the net?

GM: Your throwing talons might help cut through it.

Rook: Okay, I’ll do that.

GM: Since the net is immobile, do you want to roll or make a routine check?

Rook: If I roll, I get a damage bonus, right? The GM nods. Okay, I’l

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

241

The following is an example of the M&M rules in action during a conflict scene.

Three heroes: Princess, Rook, (see pages 50-53) and Ultramarine (a battlesuit wearer), tipped-off by one of Rook’s contacts
about smugglers unloading a shipment down at the docks late at night, have staked-out the vessel. Once they see the
smugglers moving the goods, Rook signals it is time to move in and take them down!

ROUND 1

Gamemaster (GM): Okay, everyone, make an initiative check.

The players of Princess, Rook, and Ultramarine each roll the die, adding their character’s initiative modifier and getting the fol-
lowing results: Ultramarine: 13, Rook: 11, Princess: 26!

The GM rolls one initiative check for the smugglers (with an initiative modifier of +0), getting a result of 11. Although Rook has
the same result, he has a higher initiative modifier (+5) and so will go before the smugglers. The GM also rolls a secret initiative
check result of 16 for something the players don’t know yet...

GM: Okay, you get the “go” signal from Rook and leap into action! (Looking at the initiative count) Princess, what do you
do?

Princess: I jump from the pier onto the deck of the ship as my move action, landing right in front of all the smugglers
and say, “You guys want to just give up now and save yourselves a beating? Please feel free to say no.” Then I give them a
big smile.

GM: You want to try and intimidate them? That’s a standard action. You want to make it a routine check?

Princess: No, I’ll roll for it. Princess’ player rolls an Intimidation check with her bonus of +6. I got a 16 anyway, same as my
routine check result!.

The GM compares Princess’ result to the smugglers’ Will defense, which is 12. Her check succeeded with one degree. The smug-
glers are impaired (–2 on their checks) until the end of Princess’ next turn.

GM: The smugglers look shocked at your sudden appearance and hesitate, clearly shaken. Ultramarine, it’s your turn.

Ultramarine: Like shooting fish in a barrel… I surge up out of the water on the other side of the ship and fly up to the
deck (move action) then level the arm with my netline primed at the smugglers, my voice amplified by the speakers in my
suit. “Or you can call it quits right now.”

GM: You going for the Intimidation check, too?

Ultramarine: No, I think I’d rather ready an attack with my netline, if any of the smugglers decide to get stupid, then wait
to see what happens. That’s a standard action, right

PRINCESS

Julia wants to play a fairly straightforward hero: super-strong and tough, but also a beautiful
young woman with an eye for fashion! She draws a sketch of a smiling, slender woman in a

pink T-shirt that says “Princess” on it in silver sequins, holding a car over her head!

Right off, Julia knows Princess is strong, really strong. So she assigns her Strength 12;
higher than PL10, but still not so high that she can’t also have a reasonable close
combat bonus. That Strength is enough for Princess to lift a hundred tons! She

can heft that car with ease! Julia gives her Stamina 12 to match.

Since she sees Princess as graceful, like a gymnast, Julia gives her Agility
5, but she goes with Dexterity 3, since her character isn’t as coordinated
(although she’s still above average). Likewise, Julia assigns Princess 2 ranks
each  in  Intellect,  Awareness,  and  Presence;  she’s  smart,  sassy,  and  deter-
mined, but not amazingly so. Julia wants Princess to be a capable close-up
fighter, so she gives her Fighting 6. That’s a total of 44 ranks in abilities for 88

power points, leaving 62 remaining.

Next up: powers. Julia wants Princess to be fast and tough. She gives her 4 ranks of
Speed, allowing her to keep up with a slow-moving car, and assigns her 5 ranks in Im-
munity (allowing her to ignore cold, disease, heat, pressure, and radiation) along with some
Impervious Toughness (8 ranks) and Regeneration (2 ranks). That’s 19 points in powers,

43 remaining.

Given her great Strength and Agility, Julia also sees Princess as being able to jump re-
ally far, so she gives her 7 ranks in Leaping as well. That’s another 7 points, leaving 36.

Julia looks over the advantage list, taking notes as she goes. She likes the idea of
Princess being a real toughy: having things like Diehard and Ultimate Tough-
ness,  along  with  Interpose  (allowing  her  to  take  the  hit  for  a  teammate).
But she also wants her to be quick and inspirational. She likes Attractive,
Extraordinary  Effort,  Inspire,  and  Well-informed.  That’s  seven  advan-
tages thus far. She rounds out the list with some combat maneuvers
like All-out Attack and Power Attack (since Princess can cut loose if
she needs to), Improved Initiative (she’s quick) and another rank
of Inspire. That’s another four advantages, for a total of 11 points.

Julia  asks  the  Gamemaster  about  one  more  advantage:

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

265

More  than  a  few  comic  books  speculate  about  the  fu-
ture. There are science fiction comics aplenty, along with
super-hero stories set at different points in Earth’s future.

A near future setting may be quite similar to the modern-
day, with the addition of some new technology and the
new problems that come with it. For example there may
be flying cars, cybernetic and genetic modifications, and
advances  in  computer  technology  along  with  increases
in crime and urban decay. Heroes can stalk the streets of
dark, towering cities trying to protect the innocent where
a corrupt legal system has failed.

Some  future  comic  stories  are  set  following  a  terrible
catastrophe  that  has  all  but  destroyed  civilization.  In  a
setting  like  this  the  heroes  may  be  the  last  survivors  of
ordinary  humanity,  or  super-powered  mutants,  trained
super-soldiers (perhaps intended as weapons in the Last
War), or even cyborgs or aliens. Their adventures tend to
revolve around protecting pockets of civilization from ma-
rauding  mutants  and  keeping  ambitious  warlords  from
conquering the world or destroying innocent people.

Far future settings feature faster-than-light space travel, al-
lowing heroes to visit (or come from) any of dozens or even
hundreds  of  different  worlds.  A  team  made  up  of  heroes
from  these  different  worlds  could  band  together  to  pro-
tect the interstellar government from hostile alien invaders
while also dealing with disasters, space pirates, and crimi-
nal  cartels.  Or  a  group  can  explore  the  unknown  reaches
of space on board a starship, encountering would-be con-
querors, despots, raiders, and other villains along the way.

STYLE

Just as comics themselves span the stylistic gamut from
lighthearted  adventure  to  intricately  plotted,  grim  mo-
rality  plays,  so  can  a  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  series  vary  in
style. Once a style of play is established, it’s up to the GM
to  maintain  it.  That  means  creating  adventures  and  en-
counters suited to that style and encouraging the players
to get into the style’s mindset and run their characters ac-
cordingly. Styles run along a spectrum from light to dark:

LIGHT

The light style is simple and straightforward. The heroes
are the good guys and the villains are usually bad through
and  through  (with  a  few  misunderstood  souls  in  need
of help). Problem solving is a matter of eith

appropriate type of check, a Difficulty Class, and make a
roll to see if the character succeeds or not! It’s that simple.

RANK

Every trait in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS —abilities, skills, pow-
ers, and so forth—has an associated rank, a value telling
you how strong (or weak) that trait is. Ranks run from –5
(very  weak)  all  the  way  up  to  20  (incredibly  strong)  or
more. You can rate virtually any trait by its rank. With the
correspondence of rank and measure, you can rate virtu-
ally  anything—distance,  weight,  time,  and  so  forth—by
rank.

Every  task—from  making  an  attack  to  avoiding  harm  to
figuring out a gadget—has a Difficulty Class or DC, a value
that tells you how hard that task is to perform. DCs range
from  0  (automatic,  so  easy  it’s  not  worth  rolling)  to  40
(nearly impossible).
CHECKS

Actions in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS are all resolved through
checks, a roll of a 20-sided die, plus a modifier. If the total
of the check equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class, the ac-
tion is a success. If it doesn’t, then it’s a failure.

Beneficial conditions apply a +2 bonus on the check (+5
for very highly beneficial), adverse conditions impose a –2
penalty (–5 for highly adverse). This is true whether you’re
trying to use a skill, make an attack, use a power, or what
have you.

Avoiding  an  effect  is  a  resistance  check,  with  a  Difficulty
Class of 10 + the effect’s modifier or rank. A successful re-
sistance means you avoid the effect, a failed check means
you suffer some (or all) of the effect.

THAT’S IT!

That’s the core of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS: roll d20 + rank and
modifiers vs. a Difficulty Class. If you understand that, you
can do pretty much anything in the game. The rest is just
detail. When in doubt, or whenever you want to speed the
game along, just have a player make a check of the appro-
priate trait rank against a DC based on how difficult the
task is and you can’t really go wrong.

Part of the Gamemaster’s job is to make sure the game
is fair and balanced, so everyone can have a good time
and all the heroes have an equal chance of doing some

255

fun and exciting things in the course of the adventure. It
can be tricky sometimes, but MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS gives
you  tools  for  balancing  the  traits  of  the  heroes  against
different  challenges  and  handling  problems  that  may
come up.

While MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS presents a fairly complete and
balanced game
