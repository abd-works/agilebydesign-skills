ground  speed  minus  one  rank,  if  you  choose.  If  you  fail,
you are still grabbed.

GRAB

You  attempt  to  grab  a  target.  Make  an  attack  check
against the target. If successful, the target makes a resis-
tance check against your Strength (or the rank of a grab-
bing effect) using the better of Strength or Dodge. If you
win with one degree of success, the target is restrained
(immobile  and  vulnerable). Two  or  more  degrees  leave
your  opponent  bound  (defenseless,  immobile,  and  im-
paired).  You  can  attempt  to  improve  an  existing  hold
with another grab action on a following turn. Any result-
ing  degrees  of  success  are  cumulative,  but  if  you  lose,
the target escapes.

You  are  hindered  and  vulnerable  while  grabbing  and
holding an opponent. You can maintain a successful grab
as a free action each turn, but cannot perform other ac-
tions requiring the use of your grabbing limb(s) while do-
ing so. Since maintaining a grab is a free action, you can
take a standard action to inflict your Strength damage to
a grabbed target on subsequent turns after the grab is es-
tablished.

You can drag a restrained or bound target along with you
when  you  move.  The  target  gets  a  Strength  resistance
check  against  your  Strength.  If  it  fails,  you  move  and  the
target moves along with you. If the target resists, you are
immobilized that turn unless you release your hold on the
target.

You can end a grab (releasing your target) as a free action.
If you are unable to take the free action maintain the hold,
the target is automatically released. A target can attempt
to escape from a grab as a move action (see Escape).

MOVE

You can move up to your normal speed rank in any move-
ment mode available to you as a move action. Normally
this is rank 0 ground speed for most people (up to 30 feet).
If  you  choose  to  move  twice  on  your  turn  (taking  two
move actions) then you move your speed rank each time.
You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to
run faster: one or more degree of success increases your
ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

READY

Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you
would normally act on your initiative, but before your ini-
tiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so
you can move as well.

If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed
your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied ac-
tion, y

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

You can get a general idea of just how good a particu-
lar character’s skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class  guidelines  given  in  The  Basics  along  with  the
rules  for  routine  checks  (see  Routine  Checks  in  that
chapter).

For  example,  a  +5  total  skill  modifier  means  the  char-
acter can routinely achieve a result of 15 (a tough task).
Safe to say the character is a pro, able to routinely han-
dle tasks that would prove too much for someone less
skilled.  A  character  with  a  +10  skill  modifier  achieve  a
DC 20 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of
expertise, while a +15 modifier can routinely complete
DC  25  (formidable)  tasks.  At  the  high  end,  a  +30  skill
modifier  can  routinely  accomplishing  the  nigh  impos-
sible (DC 40 tasks)!

Certain skills, called interaction skills, are aimed at deal-
ing  with  others  through  social  interaction.  Interaction
skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get
them to cooperate with you in one way or another. Since
interaction skills are intended for dealing with others so-
cially, they have certain requirements.

First,  you  must  be  able  to  interact  with  the  subject(s)  of
the  skill. They  must  be  aware  of  you  and  able  to  under-
stand you. If they can’t hear or understand you for some
reason, you have a –5 circumstance penalty to your skill
check (see Circumstance Modifiers in The Basics).

Interaction  skills  work  best  on  intelligent  subjects,  ones
with  an  Intellect  rank  of  –4  or  better. You  can  use  them
on creatures with Int –5, but again with a –5 circumstance
penalty;  they’re  just  too  dumb  to  get  the  subtleties  of
your  point. You  can’t  use  interaction  skills  at  all  on  sub-
jects lacking one or more mental abilities. (Try convincing
a  rock  to  be  your  friend—or  afraid  of  you—sometime.)

If you don’t find a particular skill on the list, like climbing,
bluffing, or search, remember that each skill in MUTANTS &
covers a lot of ground. So, you’ll find climbing
isn’t its own skill, but is listed as part of Athletics, while
bluffing and search are under Deception and Investiga-
tion, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill
you think is most similar to what you’re looking for.

The  Immunity  effect  (see  the  Powers  chapter)  can  also
render characters immune to interaction skills.

You  can  use  interaction  skills  on  groups  of  subjects

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

HIDING

OPERATING

If you have cover or concealment, make a Stealth check,
opposed by an observer’s Perception check, to hide and
go unnoticed.

If  others  are  aware  of  your  presence,  you  can’t  use
Stealth  to  remain  undetected.  You  can  run  around  a
corner so you are out of sight and then use Stealth, but
others know which way you went. You can’t hide at all if
you have absolutely no cover or concealment, since that
means you are standing out in plain sight. Of course, if
someone isn’t looking directly at you (you’re sneaking up
from behind, for example), then you have concealment
relative to that person.

A  successful  Deception  or  Intimidation  check  can  give
you the momentary distraction needed to make a Stealth
check  while  people  are  aware  of  you. When  others  turn
their attention from you, make a Stealth check if you can
reach  cover  or  concealment  of  some  kind.  (As  a  general
guideline, any such cover has to be within 1 foot for every
rank you have in Stealth.) This check, however, is at a –5
penalty because you have to move quickly.
TAILING

You  can  use  Stealth  to  tail  someone  at  your  normal
speed.  This  assumes  you  have  some  cover  or  conceal-
ment (crowds of people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject
is worried about being followed, he can make a Percep-
tion  check  (opposed  by  your  Stealth  check)  every  time
he  changes  course  (goes  around  a  street  corner,  exits  a
building,  and  so  on).  If  he  is  unsuspecting,  he  only  gets
one Perception check for the scene. If the subject notices
you, make a Deception check, opposed by Insight. If you
succeed, you manage to pass off your presence as coinci-
dence and can continue tailing. A failed Deception check,
or being noticed a second time, means the subject knows
something is up and reacts accordingly.

Most  routine  operations  of  technological  equipment
don’t require a skill check and can be done untrained. Us-
ing an unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC
determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from
simple (DC 10) to highly advanced (DC 25 or more).
BUILDING

The difficulty and time required to make an item depends
on its complexity, as shown on the Building Items table. If
your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item
after the necessary time. If the check fails, you did not pro-
duce a usable end result, and any time and materials are

Revive dazed or stunned characters.

Treat diseases or poisons.

If  you  do  not  have  the  appropriate  medical  equipment
and supplies, you take a –5 circumstance penalty on your
check.  If  your  subject  has  a  particularly  unusual  biology
(an alien, for example) you may also suffer a circumstance
penalty.

You  can  use  the Treatment  skill  on  yourself,  but  only  to
diagnose,  provide  care,  or  treat  disease  or  poison.  You
take a –5 circumstance penalty on checks when treating
yourself.
DIAGNOSIS

You  can  diagnose  injuries  and  ailments  with  an  eye  to-
ward  further  treatment.  This  takes  at  least  a  minute.  At
the GM’s discretion, a successful diagnosis provides a +2
bonus  for  favorable  circumstances  on  further Treatment
checks.

Providing  care  means  treating  an  injured  patient  for  a
day or more. If successful, the patient further reduces the
recovery  time  by  1  rank  (see  Recovery  in  the  Action  &
Adventure chapter). You can provide care for up to your
Treatment rank in patients at one time.
REVIVE

You  can  remove  the  dazed  or  stunned  conditions  from
a  subject  (see  Conditions  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). The check to revive is a standard action. A suc-
cessful  check  removes  the  condition.  Other  conditions
the patient may have remain, so reviving someone inca-
pacitated due to fatigue still leaves the patient exhaust-
ed, for example, while awakening someone incapacitat-
ed due to damage still leaves the patient staggered. You

As a standard action, a successful Treatment check stabi-
lizes a dying character.

You can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison.
Each time the character makes a resistance check against
the ailment, you make a Treatment check. One degree of
success provides the patient with a +2 circumstance bo-
nus to the resistance check, three or more degrees of suc-
cess provides a +5 circumstance bonus.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Heroes in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS cover a diverse range of power levels, from the first costumed adventurers of the Golden
Age, who relied solely on their skills and a few gimmicks (and modern vigilantes of the mean streets, who do much the
same), to the greatest protectors of the world, who take on cosmic threats on a regular basis. The following are some com-
mon power levels and starting power point values suitable for different M&M games:

LEVEL 8 - MASKED ADVENTURERS

This power level fits the “Mystery Men” era of the Golden Age of comic books, as well as for teams of mostly non-powered
adventurers: heroes who rely more on their skills and wits (and maybe a few gadgets) rather than amazing powers. The sug-
gested starting value of 120 power points creates well-rounded heroes at this level, particularly if the emphasis is on skills
and advantages—and maybe a power or two—rather than a lot of powers. Think Dr. Tomorrow and Foreshadow rather than
Captain Thunder and Daedalus. A higher starting power point total allows for more diverse capabilities within the same limits.

Heroes at this level often focus more on skill than sheer damage output, often having fighting skills in the 10–12 range,
but commensurately lower damage and effect ranks (using just their fists or small arms).

LEVEL 10 - SUPER HEROES

The suggested starting power level for MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS suits mature and experienced “adventurers” of the previous
level along with a wide range of younger or focused superhumans. This is the power level of the Sentinels, characters like
Bowman and Seven, and a great many of other heroes. It’s also good for powerful, but relatively inexperienced heroes like
Megastar when he first joined the Next-Gen.

Power level 10 heroes may have a balance of attack and effect, defense and resistance, or may go for being stronger on
one side than the other, having great combat skill, but comparatively limited damage, for example, or great Toughness,
but lowered defenses.

LEVEL 12 - BIG LEAGUES

Power level 12 is where you find many of the members of the current Freedom League: Daedalus, Lady Liberty, and the
Raven, to name a few. They are “senior” heroes, usually with considerable capabilities (and, often, experience). Those lacking
superhuman powers (such as the Raven) have amazing levels of skill and resources to draw upon while the superhuman
types are often among the most capable in

The following archetypes are ready to play for a power level 10 series. Some require a few simple choices or offer options
for customization. Gamemasters can also use these archetypes as ready-made villains, if desired.

The Gadgeteer and Martial Artist rely a great deal on their
advantages (as do other archetypes like the Crime Fighter
and Weapon Master). You’ll want to read the descriptions
of all of the character’s advantages from the Advantages
chapter so you know the benefits they provide. Remem-
ber to make use of them during play to give your charac-
ter every appropriate, well, advantage.

In particular, note how some advantages and even pow-
ers work together. The Gadgeteer can use Quick-Thinking
to speed up the process of inventing (see Inventing, page
211) and Skill Mastery (Technology) to make some invent-
ing  checks  as  routine.  Similarly,  note  the  Martial  Artist’s
Power Attack advantage, good for doing extra damage to
slow, tough, opponents, and the Skill Mastery (Acrobatics)
advantage  for  pulling  off  formidable  (DC  25)  Acrobatics
checks as routine!

The  Mimic  and  Mystic  archetypes  are  both  very  flexible,
although in different ways, and it pays to know what your
character is capable of doing before you are immersed in
the midst of a game.

In the case of the Mimic, the GM may wish to put together
note cards or some other quick reference to the powers of
other characters whom the Mimic might wish to duplicate.
That way, you can see at a glance what traits the character
can copy, and simply hand the card to the player for refer-
ence.  Experienced  Mimics  may  even  build  up  a “hand”  of
such cards they reference often.

For  the  Mystic,  in  addition  to  choosing  your  charac-
ter’s  five  set  Alternate  Effects  (see  Alternate  Effect  on
page  188),  read  the  Magic  sample  power  on  page  168
of the Powers chapter and give some thought to power
stunts your character can do; spur of the moment spells
whipped up to fit a particular need. Mytics are very effec-
tive at power stunts and you might want to reserve a hero
point (or two) for that purpose.

The  Paragon  and  Powerhouse  are  among  the  strongest
archetypes,  able  to  lift  and  carry  a  lot  of  weight.  Just  to
give you an idea, the Paragon can lift a loaded 747 aircraft,
whereas the Powerhouse can lift four times that amount.
Both can easily smash through stone or bend steel.

Both archetypes are pretty tough, to

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

effects, nor does it extend to anyone else: for that, ap-
ply the Selective extra. If the user wants to be affected
at the same time, increase cost per rank by +1. An ex-
ample would be a Close Burst Area Healing effect that
included the user along with everyone else in the area.
This is the equivalent of the +1 Affects Others modifier.

Ranged:  A  ranged  area  effect  can  be  placed  any-
where within the effect’s range, extending to fill the
area’s volume from the origin point.

Perception: A perception area effect can be placed
anywhere  the  user  can  accurately  perceive.  Percep-
tion area effects neither require an attack check nor
allow a Dodge resistance check, although targets still
get a normal resistance check against the effect. Per-
ception  area  effects  are  blocked  by  either  conceal-
ment or cover; choose one when acquiring the effect.
For concealment, if the attacker can’t accurately per-
ceive a target in the area, it is unaffected. Thus even
heavy smoke or darkness can block the effect. Effects
blocked by cover are much like conventional area ef-
fects:  solid  barriers  interfere  with  the  effect,  even  if
they are transparent, but the effect ignores conceal-
ment like darkness, shadows, or smoke. Only targets
behind total cover are unaffected.

Example: Mastermind has a Burst Area Affliction, al-
lowing him to seize control of the minds of everyone
in  the  affected  area.  He  must  be  able  to  accurately
perceive a target to control it; an invisible foe or one
out of his line of sight, for example, would be unaffect-
ed, even if they were within the area of the burst. On
the other hand, targets behind a glass wall or invisible
force field are affected, since Mastermind can perceive
them. Conversely, Fear-Master has a Burst Area Afflic-
tion as well—his fear-inducing gas. Targets behind a
solid barrier (such as on the other side of that glass
wall or invisible shield) are unaffected, but the unseen
or concealed target is, even though Fear-Master can’t
perceive him, since the gas still reaches them.

each  other  they  must  have  opposed  descriptors.  For  ex-
ample, light and darkness powers can counter each other
as can heat and cold, water and fire, and so forth. In some
cases,  such  as  magical  or  mental  effects,  powers  of  the
same descriptor can also counter each other. The GM is the
final arbiter as to whether or not an effect with a particular
descriptor can counter another. The Nullify effect (see page
173) can counter any effect of a particular descriptor!

her water powers. The GM agrees the two powers
should be able to counter each other, so he asks Si-
ren’s player to make a Water Control effect check,
while he makes a Fire Control effect check for White
Knight.  Siren’s  player  rolls  a  result  of  26  while  the
GM rolls a result of 19 for White Knight. Siren suc-
cessfully counters the flame blast, which fizzles out
in a gout of steam.

To counter an effect, you must take the ready action (see
page 248). In doing so, you wait to complete your action
until  your  opponent  tries  to  use  a  power.  You  may  still
move, since ready is a standard action.

You must be able to use the readied effect as a standard
action or less. Effects usable as a reaction do not require
a ready action; you can use them to counter at any time.
Effects  requiring  longer  than  a  standard  action  cannot
counter during action rounds (although they may be able
to counter ongoing effects, see the following section).

If an opponent attempts to use a power you are able to
counter,  use  your  countering  effect  as  your  readied  ac-
tion. You and the opposing character make effect checks
(d20 + rank). If you win, your two powers cancel each oth-
er out and there is no effect from either. If the opposing
character  wins,  your  attempt  to  counter  is  unsuccessful.
The opposing effect works normally.

Example: Siren, goddess of the seas, is fighting the
White  Knight.  The  hate-mongering  villain  hurls  a
blast of white-hot fire (a Ranged Damage effect).
Having prepared an action, Siren’s player says she
wants  to  counter  White  Knight’s  fire  blast  with

You can also use one power to counter the ongoing effect
of another, or other lingering results of an instant effect
(like flames ignited by a fiery Damage effect). This requires
a  normal  use  of  the  countering  effect  and  an  opposed
check, as above. If you are successful, you negate the ef-
fect (although the opposing character can attempt to re-
establish

is one degree of success, just as a result of 8 is one degree
of failure.

There is no limit to the number of degrees a check may have,
although more than two degrees of failure rarely matters,
and some degrees of success may have no further effect be-
yond a certain point (once you have succeeded as well as
is possible in a given situation). For example, failure on an
Acrobatics check to balance means you wobble and spend
that  turn  maintaining  your  balance,  but  don’t  move. Two
degrees of failure mean you lose your balance and fall! After
that point, further degrees of failure don’t really matter.

In cases where a single degree of success or failure is suffi-
cient, the rules simply specify “success” or “failure” without
giving a degree.

Specific types of graded checks—notably skill and resis-
tance checks—give specific results for degrees of success
and failure in their descriptions.

Some circumstances make checks easier or harder, result-
ing in a bonus or penalty to the check. Characters in a fa-
vorable situation are said to have a circumstance bonus
for the check, while those in a disadvantageous situation
are said to be have a circumstance penalty.

As  a  general  rule,  apply  a  modifier  of  plus  or  minus  2  if
the character is at a minor bonus or minor penalty, and
a modifier of plus or minus 5 if the character is at a major
bonus or major penalty for the check:

Technically,  circumstance  modifiers  could  apply  to  ei-
ther the check result of the difficulty class of a check, af-
fecting the character’s performance, or making the task
itself  easier  or  harder.  If  you  want  to  differentiate  be-
tween circumstance modifiers that affect performance
versus those that modify the difficulty of a task, feel free
to  do  so.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  applies  circumstance
modifiers directly to the check result because it is easier
to deal with them consistently, and the game effect is
the same: the chance of success changes.

Circumstance  modifiers  are  another  useful  Gamemas-
ter  tool  for  handling  a  lot  of  the  variables  that  come
up  during  game  play.  Specific  examples  are  discussed
throughout  the  rules  for  various  types  of  checks.  One
example includes the following:

Some  tasks  require  tools.  If  tools  are  needed,  the  spe-
cific items are mentioned in the description of the task

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

143

In  some  settings,  the  Gamemaster  may  require  certain
descriptors  for  all  powers.  Usually,  a  required  descrip-
tor reflects some common element of the series. For ex-
ample, if all characters with powers are mutants, then all
powers  have  the “mutant”  descriptor  by  definition,  un-
less  the  player  comes  up  with  a  good  explanation  why
they should not. If all superhumans are psychic mutants,
then  all  powers  have  both  the  “psychic”  and  “mutant”
descriptors. The GM sets the rules as far as what descrip-
tors are required (or restricted) in the series. A character
who breaks this guideline—say the one alien in a setting
where all powers are otherwise mutant in origin—might
have a Benefit (unusual origin) or face certain complica-
tions, possibly both.

Effects with a duration of instant, concentration, or sustained
must be noticeable in some way. For example, a Blast effect
might  have  a  visible  beam  or  make  a  loud  noise  (ZAP!)  or
both. Some effects are quite obvious, such as Flight, Insub-
stantiality, Growth, or Shrinking. Effects with a continuous or
permanent duration are not noticeable by default.

If an instant, concentration, or sustained effect’s base dura-
tion is changed using modifiers, the effect remains notice-
able. A continuous or permanent effect made instant, con-
centration, or sustained also becomes noticeable. The Subtle
modifier (see page 196) can make noticeable powers difficult
or impossible to detect. Conversely, the Noticeable modifier
(see page 200) makes a normally subtle effect noticeable.

traits other than abilities, skills, and advantages. Whether a
character  with  powers  is “superhuman”  or  not  is  largely  a
matter of opinion and the descriptors used. For example,

traits  still  considered “normal”

Of course, fame has its drawbacks, which include persis-
tent fans, greater public scrutiny, and things like constant
offers  for  product  endorsements  and  such.  Famous  he-
roes are more likely to be targeted by supervillains look-
ing to make a name for themselves or novice heroes want-
ing to join an established team. While the heroes are most
trusted  by  the  authorities,  they’re  also  more  likely  to  be
called upon in times of need.

On  the  other  hand,  heroes  may  also  become  infamous
for their deeds, particularly if they’re known to be ruth-
less or mercenary. Infamy may dog heroes with bad pub-
licity, whether or not they’re actually guilty of anything.
After enough “Threat or Menace?” editorials, people start
to  wonder  if  the  hero  really  is  a  good  guy.  Reversals  in
reputation and sudden infamy make for good complica-
tions.

HONORS

In  addition  to  fame  and  fortune,  heroes  may  receive  the
gratitude  of  the  people  they  help. They  get  awards  from
civic groups and organizations like the police and fire de-
partments. The mayor gives them the key to the city or ar-
ranges for a parade in their honor (or both). The governor or
President honors them on national television. Monuments
may  be  erected  in  their  honor  and  charitable  institutions
founded or dedicated in their names. A hero team’s trophy
room can contain various plaques, medals, and other acco-
lades right alongside captured criminal memorabilia.

An  awards  ceremony  makes  a  good  ending  to  an  adven-
ture or, perhaps, the beginning of one. After all, what villain
can resist so public a target as a hated enemy receiving an
award? And so you’re off creating your next adventure!

Run a few MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games and, before you know, you will have an ongoing series, just like a comic series
created by you and your players! While you can simply create and run adventures, it is often helpful to have a map of
roughly where your series is going, much like the outline of an adventure’s various encounters. This section looks at
creating your own M&M series and, in effect, your very own universe! The primary elements of your series to consider
are its scale, setting, and style.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

EQUIPMENT

In addition to their amazing devices, characters often make use of various mundane equipment—ordinary things found
in the real world—ranging from a simple set of tools to cell phones, laptop computers, and even common appliances.
These items are known as equipment to differentiate them from devices.

EQUIPMENT

Equipment  is  acquired  with  points  from  the  Equipment
advantage. Each piece of equipment has a cost in points,
just  like  other  traits.  The  character  pays  the  item’s  cost
out of the points from the Equipment advantage and can
thereafter have and use that item.

An  item’s  cost  is  based  on  its  effects  and  features,  just
like a power (see the Powers chapter for more informa-
tion), so a ranged weapon has a cost based on its Ranged
Damage  rank.  Equipment  often  provides  the  Features
effect,  including  some  specific  equipment  Features  de-
scribed in this chapter. Indeed, some items of equipment
provide only Features.

Just as with power effects, there is a diminishing value in
having multiple items with a similar function, or a single
piece of equipment with multiple functions, usable only
one at a time. Equipment can have the Alternate Effect
modifier (see the Extras section of the Powers chapter),
such as a weapon capable of different modes of opera-
tion, or a reconfigurable tool.

Characters can also have Alternate Equipment, an array of
items usable only one at a time. This is typically a multi-
function  item,  or  a  kit  or  collection  of  various  smaller
items. The  classic  example  is  the  utility  belt  (see  its  de-
scription  later  in  this  chapter).  Alternate  Equipment  can
also  include  things  like  an  arsenal  of  weapons  the  char-
acter can swap out, providing different sets of weapons,
with only a limited number usable at once.

Characters may not necessarily carry all their equipment
with them at all times. The GM may allow players to spend
a hero point in order to have a particular item of equip-
ment “on-hand” at a particular time. This is essentially an
equipment  “power  stunt”—a  one-time  use  of  the  item
for  one  scene—and  the  Gamemaster  rules  whether  or
not having a particular item on-hand is even possible. For
example, a hero out for an evening in his secret identity
might have something like a concealed weapon or other
small item on-hand, but it’s unlikely the character is carry-

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

189

Arrays—collections of Alternate Effects—are one of the more complex and important constructs in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS
and require some special care in terms of their creation and use. Players should take these things into account when
creating characters with arrays, and Gamemasters should consider them when approving such characters and dealing
with them in play.

The main reason for the Alternate Effect modifier is to allow a degree of flexibility in terms of a character’s power effects
within the cost restrictions laid down by having a finite number of power points. It’s based on the assumption that a wide
range of powers has a diminishing return in terms of value, since characters can only use so many effects at once. A power
with various “settings,” usable one at a time, is more valuable than a power with only one, but not as valuable as various
effects all usable at the same time.

However, Alternate Effect can be abused to try and squeeze the most “efficiency” out of a character’s power points, gain-
ing the most effects for the lowest cost. The guidelines for Alternate Effects are intended to help limit this somewhat, but
there is no way they can eliminate the possibility entirely and still provide all the benefits of flexibility they’re intended to
offer. Some Gamemaster oversight is therefore necessary when it comes to the creation and use of arrays.

Before giving a character Alternate Effects, it is wise to ask, “Is an array really needed for this concept?” Some concepts,
such as a variety of different attacks, clearly call for an array. Others, like a power with a few rarely used stunts, may not call
for an array. Such a power may be better served by acquiring such occasional stunts through extra effort and the spend-
ing of hero points rather than the creation of a permanent set of Alternate Effects. That is what the power stunts rules are
for, after all: so you do not have to fill up character sheets with minor Alternate Effects a hero will rarely ever use.

If you decide an array is appropriate, the first thing is to determine its overall theme and associated descriptors. Is it an ar-
ray of different attacks, like a “weapons array” of a battlesuit? Is it a collection of regular power stunts for a themed power
like earth control, or spells for magic? Is it a series of alternate forms for a metamorph? And so forth. Arrays should have
some unifying theme beyond “all the powers I want my hero to have,” and Gamemasters s

To improve your hero’s Toughness, see Advantages and
Powers, following. See the Abilities chapter for details.
5. SKILLS

Choose  the  skill  ranks  you  want  your  character  to  have
and pay 1 power point per 2 total skill ranks. See the Skills

6. ADVANTAGES

Choose the advantages you want your character to have
and pay 1 power point per advantage or rank in a advan-

Create  your  hero’s  powers  by  choosing  their  desired  ef-
fects  and  paying  the  effects’  base  cost,  adjusted  for  any
modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks. See the
Powers chapter for details.
8. COMPLICATIONS

Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can
have more, if you want, and the more complications your
hero  faces,  the  greater  your  chances  for  earning  hero

points during the game. See the Complications section
of this chapter for details.
9. DETAILS

Go  through  the  limits  listed  under  Power  Level  in  this
chapter and make sure your hero’s traits all fit within them.
If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.

Go back through and add up the costs of your hero’s abili-
ties, defenses, skills, advantages, and powers. You should
end  up  with  a  figure  equal  to  the  starting  power  points
shown on the Starting Power Points table. If not, double-
check your math and either remove or add traits to your
character to reach the starting power point total.

Figure out things like your hero’s name, appearance, origin,
background, and motivation. If you can, consider creating a
sketch or detailed description of your hero’s costume.

10. GAMEMASTER APPROVAL

Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The
GM should check again to make sure your power points
are  spent  and  added  up  correctly,  your  hero  follows  the
power  level  guidelines  and  any  other  guidelines  set  for
the  series,  and  that  the  character  is  generally  complete
and  suited  to  the  overall  game.  Once  your  GM  has  ap-
proved, your new hero is ready for play!

You design a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero by spending pow-
er points on different traits. Each ability, skill, advantage,

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

feature and require characters to pay for it if their charac-
ters have such a costume. Otherwise characters have to
make do with ordinary clothing (which may be damaged
or destroyed when they use their powers).

Some devices are otherwise normal equipment with spe-
cial properties. Magical items, normal equipment imbued
with  magical  properties,  are  examples.  Magical  weap-
ons  may  have  greater  damage  bonuses  or  grant  attack
bonuses  while  magical  armor  imposes  no  penalties  and
provides  greater  protection.  Such  enchantments  move
archaic weapons and armor from the realm of mundane
equipment to devices. The same is true of equipment us-
ing super-alloys, bulletproof cloth, and other wonders of
super-science.

WEAPONS

Weapons are common devices, ranging from super-pow-
ered versions of ordinary weapons like swords, bows, or
guns  (see  Enhanced  Equipment)  to  more  exotic  weap-
ons  like  magic  wands  or  alien  power  rings.  A  weapon
device  usually  has  one  or  more  attack  effects  but  may
provide  virtually  any  effect  the  player  wants  to  include.
Weapons often have several different attacks as Alternate
Effects. One example is an array of magic rings, each with
its own effect, but only usable one at a time.

The full range of devices MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS characters
can create and use is limited solely by your imagination.
Essentially any item with a power is considered a device.
Players and GMs may well come up with devices beyond
those  described  here.  Use  the  guidelines  in  this  chapter
and in the Powers chapter to handle any new devices and
their capabilities.

INVENTING

Characters with the Inventor advantage can create inven-
tions,  temporary  devices. To  create  an  invention,  the  in-
ventor defines its effects and its cost in power points. This
cost is used for the necessary skill checks, and determines
the time required to create the invention. Inventions are
subject to the same power level limits as other effects in
the series.

First,  the  inventor  must  design  the  invention.  This  is  a
Technology skill check the GM should make in secret. The
DC is 10 + the invention’s total power point cost, including
all modifiers except Removable, which does not apply to
inventions, as they are temporary by nature.

Designing an invention requires an hour’s work per power
point of the invention’s cost. You can make a routi

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Heroes in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS cover a diverse range of power levels, from the first costumed adventurers of the Golden
Age, who relied solely on their skills and a few gimmicks (and modern vigilantes of the mean streets, who do much the
same), to the greatest protectors of the world, who take on cosmic threats on a regular basis. The following are some com-
mon power levels and starting power point values suitable for different M&M games:

LEVEL 8 - MASKED ADVENTURERS

This power level fits the “Mystery Men” era of the Golden Age of comic books, as well as for teams of mostly non-powered
adventurers: heroes who rely more on their skills and wits (and maybe a few gadgets) rather than amazing powers. The sug-
gested starting value of 120 power points creates well-rounded heroes at this level, particularly if the emphasis is on skills
and advantages—and maybe a power or two—rather than a lot of powers. Think Dr. Tomorrow and Foreshadow rather than
Captain Thunder and Daedalus. A higher starting power point total allows for more diverse capabilities within the same limits.

Heroes at this level often focus more on skill than sheer damage output, often having fighting skills in the 10–12 range,
but commensurately lower damage and effect ranks (using just their fists or small arms).

LEVEL 10 - SUPER HEROES

The suggested starting power level for MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS suits mature and experienced “adventurers” of the previous
level along with a wide range of younger or focused superhumans. This is the power level of the Sentinels, characters like
Bowman and Seven, and a great many of other heroes. It’s also good for powerful, but relatively inexperienced heroes like
Megastar when he first joined the Next-Gen.

Power level 10 heroes may have a balance of attack and effect, defense and resistance, or may go for being stronger on
one side than the other, having great combat skill, but comparatively limited damage, for example, or great Toughness,
but lowered defenses.

LEVEL 12 - BIG LEAGUES

Power level 12 is where you find many of the members of the current Freedom League: Daedalus, Lady Liberty, and the
Raven, to name a few. They are “senior” heroes, usually with considerable capabilities (and, often, experience). Those lacking
superhuman powers (such as the Raven) have amazing levels of skill and resources to draw upon while the superhuman
types are often among the most capable in

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS
CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

Heroes sneak into the closely guarded lairs of criminal masterminds, infiltrate alien computer systems, and build devices
beyond the understanding of modern science. They can piece together obscure clues to a villain’s latest plot, run along
tightropes, and pilot vehicles through obstacle courses, all in a day’s work. In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, they do so through
the use of various skills, described in this chapter.

Skills are learned abilities, a combination of training (the skill) and natural talent (an ability rank). Each skill has a rank,
used as a bonus to the die roll when using the skill. To make a skill check, roll:

d20 + skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers

Your rank in a skill, based on the points you have invested
in that skill. If you have ranks in a skill you’re considered
trained  in  that  skill. You  can  use  some  skills  even  if  you
don’t have any ranks in them, known as using a skill un-
trained. Some skills may not be used untrained.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored  a  critical  success.  Determine  the  degree  of  suc-
cess  normally  and  then  increase  it  by  one  degree.  This
can turn a low-level success into something more signifi-
cant, but more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-
fledged success!

Each  skill  has  an  ability  modifier  applied  to  the  skill’s
checks. Each skill’s ability modifier is noted in its descrip-
tion and on the Skills table. If you use a skill untrained, the
ability modifier still applies to the skill check.

Miscellaneous modifiers to skill checks include modifiers
for circumstances, and bonuses from advantages or pow-
ers, among others.

The higher the total, the better the result. You’re usually look-
ing  for  a  total  that  equals  or  exceeds  a  particular  difficulty
class (DC), which may be based on another character’s traits.

Give your hero skill ranks by spending power points: 2 skill
ranks per power point. Skill ranks do not all need to be as-
signed to the same skill. You can split them between differ-
ent  skills.  Characters  can  perform  some  tasks  without  any
training,  using  only  raw  talent  (as  defined  by  their  ability
ranks), but skilled characters are better at such things. Those
with  the  right  combinations  of  skills  and  advantages  can
even hold their own against super-powered opponents.

Skill Cost = 1 power point per
2 skill ranks.

stories and to resolve conflicts between characters and the challenges they face. With it, you can experience adventure
as a hero fighting against the forces of evil! Any adventure you can imagine is possible.

Like all games, MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS has rules. This chapter looks at the basic rules of the game and how they work,
giving you the foundation upon which the rest of the game is built.

uses a standard, or “core,” game me-
chanic to resolve actions. Whenever a character attempts
an action with a chance of failure, do the following:

•

•

•

Roll a twenty-sided die (or d20).

Add any relevant modifiers (for game traits like abili-
ties, skills, powers, or circumstances) to the number
rolled.

Compare  the  total  to  a  number  called  a  difficulty
class (abbreviated DC).

If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class (set by the
GM  based  on  the  circumstances),  the  effort  succeeds.  If
the result is lower than the difficulty class, it fails.

This simple mechanic is used for nearly everything in MU-
MASTERMINDS, with variations based on what modi-
fiers are made to the roll, what determines the difficulty
class, and the exact degree of success and failure. Remem-
ber...

d20 + modifiers vs. difficulty class

... and you understand how to play most of the game!

One of the players in a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game takes
the  role  of  Gamemaster  (abbreviated  GM).  The  Game-
master is responsible for running the game—a combina-
tion  of  writer,  director,  and  referee.  The  GM  creates  the
adventures for the heroes, portrays the villains and sup-
porting characters, describes the world to the players, and
decides the outcome of the heroes’ actions based on the
roll of the die and the guidelines given in the rules. It’s a
big  job,  but  also  a  rewarding  one,  since  the  Gamemas-
ter gets to develop the world and all the characters in it,
along with inventing fun and exciting stories.

If  you’re  going  to  be  the  Gamemaster,  you  should  read
through this whole book carefully. You should have a firm
grasp of the rules, since you’re expected to interpret them
for the players to help decide what happens in the game.
You’ll  also  help  the  players  develop  their  own  heroes,
making sure they fit into the world and have potential for
exciting stories in their own right.

Spread throughout this section are boxes like this one,
providing  examples  of  some  of  the  most  common
powers  found  amongst  superhero  characters  to  give
you a “menu” of pre-fabricated powers to choose from
when  creating  your  own  heroes  (and  villains)  in  MU-
MASTERMINDS.  Sample  powers  are  presented  on
the Power Effects table in italics.

Each power is presented in the following format:

NAME

Effect(s): Modifier(s) • Cost

Name: What the power is called. Feel free to mod-
ify the name to suit how you’re using the power.

Effects: The power’s effect or effects are listed by
name.

Modifiers:  Any  modifiers  applying  to  the  effect
are  listed  with  it.  If  a  power  has  multiple  effects,
each is listed with its applicable modifiers.

Cost: Lastly, the power’s cost is given. This is a cost
per rank of the power if it has a ranked effect, oth-
erwise it is a flat cost in power points. Some pow-
ers may have a flat cost for the initial power, plus a
cost per rank for additional ranks.

Effect: Varies, Activation • effects total –1 or 2 points

isting degrees on the target. For example, if you hit a target
and impose a vulnerable condition (one degree), then at-
tack again and get one degree on the effect, you impose
the Affliction’s second degree condition. +1 cost per rank.

Extra  Condition:  Your  Affliction  imposes  an  additional
condition per degree of success. So with one application of
this extra, your Affliction imposes two conditions—such as
dazed  and  hindered,  or  impaired  and  vulnerable—rather
than just one. With two applications, it imposes three con-
ditions,  and  so  forth.  Since  mutually  incompatible  condi-
tions  are  largely  wasted,  Afflictions  with  this  extra  often
have the Limited Degree flaw as well. +1 cost per rank.

Progressive: This modifier causes an Affliction to increase
incrementally  without  any  effort  from  you.  If  the  target
fails  a  resistance  check  to  end  the  Affliction,  it  not  only
persists, but increases in effect by one degree! So a target
affected by the first degree of a Progressive Affliction who
fails to resist progresses to the second degree of the effect
at the start of his next round. A successful resistance check
still ends the Affliction, as usual. +2 cost per rank.

Example:  Makeshift  needs  to  whip  up  a  mind-
shielding  device  to  confront  Gepetto,  who  has
seized control of his teammates. Immunity to Mind
Control (a common Affliction effect) cost 5 power
points, so the Technology check is DC 15 (10 + 5)
and takes 5 hours. Makeshift’s skill bonus is +15, so
he succeeds automatically. The construction check
is  also  DC  15  (10  +  the  device’s  cost).  It  takes  20
hours. Makeshift again succeeds automatically on
the  check.  However,  that’s  25  hours  total  to  build
the  mind-shield,  and  Gepetto  plans  to  send  his
new “puppets” into action in just a few hours. Even
taking a –15 check penalty to cut the time to one-
eighth only takes it down to just over three hours.
Makeshift needs that device right now, so he’s go-
ing to need to speed things up....

you speed up the process any further by taking a check
penalty.  You  can  use  a  jury-rigged  invention  again  by
spending another hero point.

Example:  Needing  to  get  the  mind  shield  device
ready  right  away,  Makeshift’s  player  decides  to
spend a hero point to jury-rig it. He skips the design
step  altogether  and  reduces  construction  time  to
5 rounds (just under a minute). The DC of the con-
struction check increases to 20, but still well within
Makeshift’s skill; the player only needs to roll a 5 or
better. He rolls a 25 result on the check and, a min-
ute later, Makeshift has a makeshift mind-shield he
hopes will protect him from Gepetto’s power long
enough to try and free his teammates from the vil-
lain’s influence.

DEVICES

MISHAPS

An inventor can choose to spend a hero point to jury-rig a
device; ideal for when a particular device is needed right
now.  When  jury-rigging  a  device,  skip  the  design  check
and  reduce  the  time  of  the  construction  check  to  one
round  per  power  point  of  the  device’s  cost,  but  increase
the DC of the check by +5. The inventor makes the check
and, if successful, has use of the device for one scene be-
fore it burns out, falls apart, blows up, or otherwise fails.
You can’t jury-rig an invention as a routine check, nor can

At  the  GM’s  discretion,  three  or  more  degrees  of  failure,
or a natural roll of 1, on any required inventing skill check
may result in some unexpected side-effect or mishap. Ex-

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

It’s that simple. Note that, practically speaking, a major cir-
cumstance modifier effectively shifts a check up or down
a  degree  of  difficulty,  as  shown  on  the  Difficulty  Class
Examples  table.  Likewise,  a  major  modifier  effectively
changes the degree of a graded check by one (see Grad-
ed Checks in Chapter 1).

Routine checks reflect that some tasks and situations are
so  trivial  it  is  not  worth  having  a  player  roll  a  check.  It
would be illogical for the character to have a real chance
of failing at the task, since failure should be rare enough
to constitute a complication in that situation. Examples in-
clude things like a competent driver handling a car under
ordinary conditions or a trained professional performing
the routine tasks of a job.

Routine checks save time, because you do not need to ask
players  for  a  check  for  every  single  thing  their  characters
do, but they also provide valuable guidelines for when you
should ask the players for a check while running the game.
They  set  a  threshold  for  the  Difficulty  of  certain  actions.
When coming up with Difficulty Classes for your adventure,
keep the routine check rule in mind. If the DC is low enough
that anyone can succeed as a routine check, then it may be
too low, or the action may not be worth assigning a check.

Take Perception, for example. If you decide it is a DC 10
Perception  check  to  pick  up  on  some  clue  or  bit  of  in-
formation in the adventure, that Difficulty is low enough
that anyone with an unimpaired (0 or higher) Awareness
can succeed at the task as a routine check. Assuming the
information is also important to the plot, you might be
better off to simply tell the players their characters no-
tice  it  without  calling  for  a  check.  If  there  needs  to  be
a  chance  of  failure,  then  set  a  higher  Difficulty  for  the
check. Of course, If the situation is stressful—such as the
midst of combat—then a routine check is not an option,
and  a  lower  DC  can  provide  heroes  with  a  reasonably
high chance of success with just a small chance of failure
for dramatic purposes.

“TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENS...”

Sometimes  it’s  a  good  idea  to  make  checks  secretly,  so
the players don’t necessarily know the result. This is usu-
ally  the  case  for  any  sort  of  check  where  the  characters
don’t  immediately  know  whether  they’ve  succeeded  or
failed. For example, Perce

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

This section describes the various power effects available in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS. They are listed in alphabetical order.

ATTACK

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Instant • Cost: 1 point per rank

TYPE

You can impose some debilitating condition or conditions
on a target by making a close attack. You set the conditions
your  Affliction  causes  at  each  degree  when  you  acquire  it
and they may not be changed. Higher degree conditions re-
place lower degree conditions and do not stack with them.
See the possible conditions for each degree under the Af-
fliction Resistance Check table. The target resists with For-
titude or Will defense (chosen when you take the effect):

Fortitude or Will vs.
DC [Affliction rank + 10]

Success: No effect.

Failure  (one  degree):  The  target  is  dazed,  entranced,
fatigued,  hindered,  impaired,  or  vulnerable  (choose
one). Potential descriptors include coughing or sneez-
ing,  creeping  mental  influence,  drowsiness,  euphoria,
fear, itchiness, lethargy, nausea, pain, or tipsiness.

Failure (two degrees): The target is compelled, defense-
less,  disabled,  exhausted,  immobile,  prone,  or  stunned
(choose  one).  Potential  descriptors  include  agonizing
pain, confusion, ecstasy, momentary emotional or men-
tal influence, paralysis, seizure, terror, or vomiting.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  asleep,  con-
trolled,  incapacitated,  paralyzed,  transformed  or  un-
aware (choose one).

The target of an Affliction makes a resistance check at the
end of each of his turns to remove first and second degree
conditions. Third  degree  conditions  require  a  minute  of
recovery time or outside aid, such as the Treatment skill or
Healing effect (DC 10 + rank).

The exact nature and descriptors of the Affliction are up
to you, chosen when you acquire the effect, with the GM’s
approval;  some  examples  are  provided,  but  feel  free  to
make up your own.

Powers  based  off  the Variable  effect  are  obviously  very  flexible,  capable  of  duplicating  a  wide  range  of  other  effects.
Responsibility for controlling Variable effects in the game is placed largely in the hands of both the Gamemaster and
responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with numerous game-system limitations
that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of effects.

Keep in mind a Variable effect is not supposed to be “any effect I want.” That kind of unlimited power doesn’t belong in the
hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A Variable effect can be “any effect within a
given set of parameters,” but it’s up to you and the GM to define those parameters. The limits of power flexibility in MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS are deliberately set by Variable effects, the use of extra effort, and hero points.

Many  comic  book  heroes  who  appear  to  have  the  power  to “do  anything”  are  actually  using  one  of  these  options  in
terms.  For  example,  a  super-wizard  can  do  practically  anything  with  magic.  However,  generally
speaking, these characters have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with power points) and
“stunts” they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly hero points).
This is why the Magic power given later in this chapter, for example, is not a Variable effect: most powers in the game
have the potential to do “stunts” via extra effort, so the “variability” of Magic seen in the comics is already built-in to the
system, with some costs to control it, without having to give players carte blanche to duplicate any effect in the game at
will (which is just likely to slow things down and cause game balance issues).

Variable effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and define everything about a given power in
advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an application of the Morph effect with a long
list of Metamorph options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at a time, would be tedious to say the
least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A Variable effect, with the descriptor “animal
forms” is easier to manage. The player can pre-build certain commonly used animal forms for use during play, but also ha

Insight  check.  Senses  with  the  Counters  Illusion  effect
(see Senses) automatically detect illusions. If any viewer
successfully uncovers an illusion and communicates this
fact to others, they gain another Insight check with a +5
circumstance bonus. Circumstances may grant additional
modifiers to the Insight check to uncover an illusion, de-
pending on how convincing it is.

Maintaining an active illusion (such as a fighting creature)
requires a standard action each round, but maintaining a
static illusion (one that doesn’t move or interact) is only a
free action.

EXTRAS

Illusion is a broad-ranging effect, usable for a number of
different things. A few common considerations for Illu-
sion include the following.

Independent: Your active illusions only require a free action
to maintain, rather than a standard action. +1 cost per rank.

Selective:  You  choose  who  perceives  your  Illusion  and
who doesn’t. +1 cost per rank.

For illusions so realistic they are capable of inflicting dam-
age, add a Linked Perception Range Damage effect. At the
GM’s discretion, this effect can even be made into a Linked
Array  with  a  variety  of  alternate  attack  effects,  allowing
your illusionist to inflict conditions other than damage on
targets. Keep in mind the attack effects all need to be per-
ception range to match the range of Illusion.

Illusion  can  alter  a  subject’s  appearance,  providing  an
essentially impenetrable disguise—at least until some-
one  makes  a  successful  check  to  see  through  the  illu-
sion.  However,  for  just  the  ability  to  alter  appearance,
use the Morph effect, which is generally more effective
than Illusion Limited to Appearance.

The  default  Illusion  effect  is  perceptible  to  anyone  or
anything  (including  machines)  as  if  it  were  real.  Some
illusions exist solely in the mind, like projected psychic
hallucinations. This type of Illusion has the Resistible by
Will flaw and the Selective extra, since the illusionist can
choose whether or not to project the illusion into a par-
ticular subject’s mind, and therefore decides who can or
cannot perceive the illusion. This is a net +0 modifier, for
the same base cost.
MY ALLY, MY ENEMY

A common Illusion trick is to switch the appearances of
an  enemy  and  an  ally,  causing  a  foe’s  teammate  to  at-

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

More  than  a  few  comic  books  speculate  about  the  fu-
ture. There are science fiction comics aplenty, along with
super-hero stories set at different points in Earth’s future.

A near future setting may be quite similar to the modern-
day, with the addition of some new technology and the
new problems that come with it. For example there may
be flying cars, cybernetic and genetic modifications, and
advances  in  computer  technology  along  with  increases
in crime and urban decay. Heroes can stalk the streets of
dark, towering cities trying to protect the innocent where
a corrupt legal system has failed.

Some  future  comic  stories  are  set  following  a  terrible
catastrophe  that  has  all  but  destroyed  civilization.  In  a
setting  like  this  the  heroes  may  be  the  last  survivors  of
ordinary  humanity,  or  super-powered  mutants,  trained
super-soldiers (perhaps intended as weapons in the Last
War), or even cyborgs or aliens. Their adventures tend to
revolve around protecting pockets of civilization from ma-
rauding  mutants  and  keeping  ambitious  warlords  from
conquering the world or destroying innocent people.

Far future settings feature faster-than-light space travel, al-
lowing heroes to visit (or come from) any of dozens or even
hundreds  of  different  worlds.  A  team  made  up  of  heroes
from  these  different  worlds  could  band  together  to  pro-
tect the interstellar government from hostile alien invaders
while also dealing with disasters, space pirates, and crimi-
nal  cartels.  Or  a  group  can  explore  the  unknown  reaches
of space on board a starship, encountering would-be con-
querors, despots, raiders, and other villains along the way.

STYLE

Just as comics themselves span the stylistic gamut from
lighthearted  adventure  to  intricately  plotted,  grim  mo-
rality  plays,  so  can  a  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  series  vary  in
style. Once a style of play is established, it’s up to the GM
to  maintain  it.  That  means  creating  adventures  and  en-
counters suited to that style and encouraging the players
to get into the style’s mindset and run their characters ac-
cordingly. Styles run along a spectrum from light to dark:

LIGHT

The light style is simple and straightforward. The heroes
are the good guys and the villains are usually bad through
and  through  (with  a  few  misunderstood  souls  in  need
of help). Problem solving is a matter of eith

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

POWER

Increase one of your hero’s power effects by +1 rank until
the start of the hero’s next turn. Permanent effects cannot
be increased in this way.

Temporarily  gain  and  use  an  Alternate  Effect  (see  Alter-
nate Effect in  the  Powers chapter). The  Alternate  Effect
lasts until the end of the scene or until its duration expires,
whichever comes first. Permanent effects cannot be used
for power stunts.

Gain an immediate additional resistance check against an
ongoing effect. If you’re compelled or controlled, the fa-
tigue from the extra effort doesn’t affect you until you’re
free of the effect; this is so you can’t resist yourself to ex-
haustion as a way of avoiding being controlled!

RETRY

Certain effects (see the Powers chapter) require extra ef-
fort to retry after a certain degree of failure. The extra ef-
fort merely permits another attempt to use the effect; it
grants no other benefits.

SPEED

Hero points allow players to “edit” the plot of the adven-
ture and the rules of the game to a degree. They give he-
roes the ability to do the amazing things heroes do in the
comics, but with certain limits, and they encourage play-
ers to make the sort of choices heroes do in the comics, in
order to get more hero points.

Players start each game session with 1 hero point. During
the adventure they get opportunities to earn more hero
points. Players can use various tokens (poker chips, glass
beads,  etc.)  to  keep  track  of  their  hero  points,  handing
them over to the Gamemaster when they spend them. The
Gamemaster can likewise give out tokens when awarding
hero points to the players.

Unspent hero points don’t carry over to the next adven-
ture; the heroes start out with 1 point again. Use them or
lose them! Since hero points are a finite resource, players
need  to  manage  them  carefully,  spending  them  at  the
most opportune times and taking chances to earn them
through complications. Playing it “safe” tends to eliminate
chances  of  getting  more  hero  points  while  taking  risks,
facing complications, and, in general, acting like a hero of-
fers rewards that help them out later on.

Unless otherwise noted, spending a hero point is a reac-
tion,  taking  no  time,  and  you  can  spend  as  many  hero
points as you have. You can spend hero points for any of
the following:

The  bonus  from  a  Close  Combat  skill  applies  only  to  at-
tack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses. For
a broader bonus to attack checks that is less than simply
raising  Fighting  rank,  see  the  Close  Attack  advantage  in
the Advantages chapter.

DECEPTION

Presence • Interaction

Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you
want them to believe. It covers things like acting, bluffing,
fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.

Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story.
Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move
action by taking a –5 penalty to your check.

BLUFFING

Make  a  Deception  check  to  tell  a  believable  lie  or  get
someone do go along with you.

A  bluff  is  usually  opposed  by  the  target’s  Deception  or
Insight  check.  Favorable  and  unfavorable  circumstances
weigh  heavily  on  the  outcome.  Two  circumstances  can
work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what
you  ask  goes  against  the  target’s  self-interest,  nature,  or
personality.

If it’s important, you can distinguish between a deception
that  fails  because  the  target  doesn’t  believe  it  and  one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the tar-
get gets a +10 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands serious risk, and the resistance check succeeds
by 10 or less, then the target doesn’t so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the
target’s Insight check succeeds by 11 or more, he has seen
through  the  deception,  and  would  have  refused  even  if
it had not placed unusual demands on him (that is, even
without the +10 modifier).

MODIFIER

The target wants
to believe you.

The deception is believable
and doesn’t affect the target
much either way.

The deception is a little hard
to believe or puts the target at
some kind of risk.

The deception is difficult
to believe or entails
a serious risk.

The deception is way
out there, almost too
incredible to consider.

•  Make  any  necessary  resistance  checks  to  recover

from ongoing effects.

Inform the Gamemaster and other players that your
turn is finished, allowing the next character in the ini-
tiative order to go.

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game terms, a challenge is an action or series of actions where players are called upon to make
checks of their characters’ traits, but which do not involve direct conflict, such as fighting. Some challenges are quick
and involve only a single character, such as a hero making a daring leap or acrobatic maneuver, while others are more
involved and require the efforts of a whole team, such as clearing all of the people out of a burning building or search-
ing the entire city (or world!) for an escaped criminal.

The challenges given in this section are by no means the only possible ones. They simply cover the major “building
blocks” Gamemasters can use to create challenges in their own games and offer examples. Feel free to come up with
your own challenges to test the heroes’ abilities and give the players an opportunity to come up with clever plans of
their own.

Challenges may or may not involve initiative checks, de-
pending on the nature of the challenge.

If all of the characters get a turn and it does not particu-
larly matter who goes first, then the Gamemaster can dis-
pense with initiative for the challenge. For example, if the
heroes  all  have  to  leap  across  a  chasm,  then  it  is  a  chal-
lenge they must all complete, and it does not particularly
matter which of them goes first or last in doing so (since
their actions are all virtually simultaneous).

With other challenges, it does matter who goes first, par-
ticular when the challenge is timed in some fashion. So,
for example, if the GM determines that part of a burning
building will collapse after the first round, initiative may
be  checked  to  see  which  heroes  go  before  the  collapse

1-4 RANKS

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  broken  down  into
sense types, used as descriptors for sensory effects. Here
are  the  traits  of  normal  human  senses,  for  use  when
modifying them with the options from Senses:

VISUAL

Normal  vision  is  ranged  (with  a  –1/10  feet  modifier),
acute (able to distinguish fine details) and accurate (able
to pinpoint the locations of things).
AUDITORY

Normal hearing is ranged  (with  a –1/10  feet modifier),
acute  (able  to  pick  up  details  like  differences  in  tone),
and radius (able to pick up on sounds coming from any
direction). Normal hearing is not accurate.

OLFACTORY

Normal  human  olfactory  senses,  which  lump  together
smell  and  taste  for  descriptor  purposes,  are  fairly  lim-
ited. Ordinary human olfactory senses are neither acute
nor accurate. The sense of smell is a radius sense, how-
ever, able to pick up on scents coming from any direc-
tion. Its “range” is quite limited, however, effectively only
close, except for especially strong scents.

TACTILE

The normal sense of touch is, by definition, close range.
It is accurate (in that you know the location of anything
you  can  touch)  and  radius  (in  that  you  can  feel  things
from any surface of your body).

MENTAL

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS terms, the “sixth sense” or men-
tal  sense  type  is  fairly  crude  in  normal  humans,  lim-
ited essentially to interactions with the Insight skill and
awareness of mental effects used directly on you. Thus it
is close range and has none of the Sense qualities.

concealment  for  objects  differing  in  temperature  from
their  surroundings.  If  you  have  the Track  effect,  you  can
track warm creatures by the faint heat trails they leave be-
hind. The Gamemaster is the final judge on how long the
trail remains visible.
VISION

You can view extremely small things. You can make Per-
ception checks to see tiny things nearby. Cost is 1 rank for
dust-sized  objects,  2  ranks  for  cellular-sized,  3  ranks  for

scale  opens  up  larger  potential  threats. You  can  destroy
entire worlds at these levels to demonstrate what the he-
roes are up against, whereas such a threat would wipe out
an entire smaller scale setting.

SETTING

The setting is where and when the series takes place. Is it
the modern-day, medieval times, the wild west, or the far
future solar system? Each of the following settings has its
positives  and  negatives,  and  each  is  suited  to  particular
types of games.

MODERN

Most of the time, a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS series is set in a
version of our modern world. This approach is the easiest
one by far, since there isn’t as much you have to make up.
You don’t have to explain to your players where New York
City is, for example.

If  your  M&M  game  is  set  in  the  modern-day  world,  you
may want to choose a particular city or area as the heroes’
home base. Even a truly global team needs some place to
call home, such as an orbiting satellite or the top floors of
a skyscraper.

A fun option can be to use your home city (or one near-
by) as the setting for your series. It offers a familiar locale
along  with  the  fun  of  having  superheroes  and  villains
duke it out around your local landmarks!

Many comics and series feature heroes that live in fictional
cities, places that don’t exist in the real world but are often
remarkably similar to various real world cities. You can do
something similar in your own series, perhaps based on
the place where you live.

Of course, your modern setting is not necessarily the mod-
ern universe: with parallel Earths, yours could be like the
real world, but with whatever changes you want.

The Golden Age of comics began in the 1930s and MU-
can easily be set any time in the past
seventy-five years. Players can take the roles of “mystery
men”  and  the  first  superheroes,  fighting  against  gang-
sters and the forces of the Axis in World War II. They can
be  government  agents  or  patriotic  heroes  during  the
Cold  War  with  Russia,  or  counter-culture  rebels  during
the 1960s.

But  nothing  says  you  can’t  go  farther  back  in  history  if
you  want.  Comic  books  have  told  stories  about  heroes
from nearly every time period. There’s World War I and the
American Revolutionary War. The Wild West offers cowboy
heroes,  Native  American  shaman,  and  steam-tech  weird
science. Medieval heroes could face evil wizards, goblins,
and monsters. You c

Descriptors help to bring a collection of effects and modifiers to life, differentiating them from similar (or even identical)
configurations and making them into distinct powers. Although descriptors don’t always have significant game effects
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, they’re perhaps the most important element in providing color and character to the powers
of heroes and villains.

Descriptors do have some affect on game play. In particular, descriptors often govern how certain effects interact
with each other, serving as convenient shorthand to help define an effect’s parameters. For example, Immunity and
Nullify work against effects with specific descriptors; if they were limited solely to things like effect type, it would
leave out a tremendous range of options, like “Immunity to Fire” or “Nullify Mutant Powers,” which are important to
the source material.

Descriptors  come  in  many  different  forms.  The  break-
down in this section is inexact, and deliberately so; some
descriptors fall into more than one category, while others
might not fall into any of these categories, being unique
to  that  particular  character  or  power.  Still,  the  following
are the major types of descriptors suited to MUTANTS & MAS-
powers, and things to consider when creating or
choosing powers for a character.
ORIGIN

A descriptor may relate to the origin of a power, where it
comes  from  or  what  granted  it  to  the  character.  For  ex-
ample, did he gain Speed in a scientific accident or from
years of focused meditation at a secret temple to the God
of Speed? A power’s origin may determine how it interacts
with  other  powers.  Some  powers  with  the  same  origin
might be better suited to counter each other, for example,
or  to  work  in  conjunction,  combining  their  benefits.  Ex-
amples of origin descriptors include:

•

•

•

Accidental powers are the result of random chance
or  accident:  being  struck  by  lightning,  doused  in
chemicals, exposed to exotic radiation, and so forth.
The circumstances of an accidental origin may or may
not  be  something  others  can  duplicate  (although
some are sure to try).

Bestowed powers are granted by an outside agency
of some sort, such as a deity, a technology, an alien
race,  or  another  superhuman. The  process  that  be-
stows  the  powers  can  be  transitory  or  effectively
permanent, barring some sort of plot device or GM-
created setback.

can quickly become a problem (especially when the he-
roes feel honor-bound to see their “teammate” answer for
his crimes). So it’s best to be sure everyone is on the same
page to avoid unnecessary disagreements.

Another common element in the comics is the loner char-
acter: dressed in black, often trained in stealth, and prefer-
ring to work alone. That’s all well and good in a solo story,

but difficult to include in a team of superheroes. You can
get  away  with  a  loner  who  is  a  reluctant  team  member
in-character with players who understand and play along
with the bit. Far worse is a team of loners, none of whom
get  along! You  can  accommodate  some  loner  characters
by giving them opportunities to show off their skills and
requiring a minimum level of cooperation and willingness
to  work  within  the  team.  You’re  better  off  discouraging
entire  groups  of  loners  right  from  the  beginning,  since
odds are they won’t work together for very long.

Creating a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game is a fairly simple process. First, define the threat around which the adventure
revolves. Then sketch out the overall plot, and describe the encounters the heroes are likely to have during the adven-
ture. You’ll also want to make sure you have statistics and character sheets for important supporting characters and vil-
lains. Present the players with the start of the adventure and you’re off and running. Will things go exactly the way you
planned? Probably not, but that’s part of the fun and challenge of being a Gamemaster!

HEROES...

There are a number of things to consider when you begin
planning  an  adventure,  including  the  plot  threads  from
previous adventures, complications, and the themes and
events of past adventures.

If the adventure is not the first in your series, then the first
thing to do is look over your last few adventures. Are there
any  dangling  plot  threads  left  over  from  those  stories,
ones the players might be interested in following?

If this is your first adventure, you need to consider a few
things,  including  how  to  get  the  heroes  together  as  a
team. They  may  already  be  a  team  when  the  adventure
begins—especially  if  your  players  are  using  established
heroes—or  circumstances  in  the  adventure  might  bring
them together.

The  key  things  for  a  first  adventure  are  to  introduce  the
players  to  the  setting  and  the  major  supportin

Insulating Fur: You have a layer of fur that protects
you from intense heat and cold, giving you immunity

Internal Compartment: You can carry a portion of
your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a
pouch  or  compartment  of  some  sort,  able  to  hold
objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than
your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).

Iron  Stomach: You  can  eat  anything  that’s  not  toxic
without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be:
spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.

•  Mimicry: You can imitate almost any sound you’ve
heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks
to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.

The  Feature  effect  is  intended  to  round  out  various
minor traits and abilities characters might have, but it
is entirely optional and not meant to burden MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS character design with needless amounts
of detail. It’s for traits with an actual game effect, not
merely  descriptors  or  background  color  (neither  of
which should cost any points). Ultimately, the Game-
master  decides  what  traits  merit  a  rank  (or  more)  of
Feature and what Features are permitted for any given
game or setting, using the examples given here.

If  a  “feature”  is  something  likely  to  come  up  only
occasionally, or even just once, then you are better
off  allowing  it  as  an  aspect  of  the  inspiration  and
power  stunt  rules  (see  the  Characteristics  chap-
ter), charging the player a hero point for the feature
when it comes into play. The player can then choose
whether  or  not  to  use  earned  power  points  to  ac-
quire the Feature as a regular part of the character’s
traits later on.

spotlighting, or personal theme music. The GM may

ing  Damage  resisted  by  Fortitude.  At  the  GM’s  discre-
tion,  radiation  exposure  can  lead  to  other  effects,  such
as damage to a hero’s power ranks (causing a temporary
decrease in powers).
VACUUM

The primary hazards of the vacuum of space are lack of air
and exposure to unfiltered ionizing radiation.

On  the  third  round  of  exposure  to  vacuum,  a  character
must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  20)  each  round
or suffer from aeroembolism (“the bends”). A failed check
means excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in the
creature’s  bloodstream;  the  creature  is  stunned  and  re-
mains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure.
Two or more degrees of failure impose the incapacitated
condition.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though
holding one’s breath in vacuum damages the lungs. A char-
acter who attempts to hold his breath must make a Forti-
tude check (DC 15) every round; the DC increases by 1 each
round, and on a successful check the character loses a rank
of Stamina (from the pressure on the linings of his lungs). If
the check fails, or when the character simply stops holding
his breath, he begins to suffocate: the next round, he be-
comes incapacitated . The following round, he’s dying and
cannot stabilize until returned to a normal atmosphere.

Unfiltered  radiation  bombards  any  character  trapped  in
the vacuum of space without protective gear, see Radia-
tion, previously.

Heroes able to ignore the effects of deep space must have
Immunity to suffocation, vacuum, and radiation, at a mini-
mum. See the Immunity effect in the Powers chapter for
details.

CONFLICTS

A conflict is when two or more characters go up against each other, typically in a fight of some sort. Conflict between
heroes and villains is a prime part of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS and a big element of the fun, just like the colorful and spec-
tacular fights in the superhero comic books.

ATTACKS

An attack check represents an attempt to hit a target with
an attack. When you make an attack check, roll the die and
add your bonus with that attack. If your result equals or
exceeds  the  target’s  defense,  your  attack  hits  and  may
have some effect.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus vs.
defense class

When you make an attack check and get a natural 20 (the
d20 actually shows 20), you automatically hit, regardless
of  your  target’s  defense,  and  you  score  a  threat. The  hit

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

You can get a general idea of just how good a particu-
lar character’s skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class  guidelines  given  in  The  Basics  along  with  the
rules  for  routine  checks  (see  Routine  Checks  in  that
chapter).

For  example,  a  +5  total  skill  modifier  means  the  char-
acter can routinely achieve a result of 15 (a tough task).
Safe to say the character is a pro, able to routinely han-
dle tasks that would prove too much for someone less
skilled.  A  character  with  a  +10  skill  modifier  achieve  a
DC 20 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of
expertise, while a +15 modifier can routinely complete
DC  25  (formidable)  tasks.  At  the  high  end,  a  +30  skill
modifier  can  routinely  accomplishing  the  nigh  impos-
sible (DC 40 tasks)!

Certain skills, called interaction skills, are aimed at deal-
ing  with  others  through  social  interaction.  Interaction
skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get
them to cooperate with you in one way or another. Since
interaction skills are intended for dealing with others so-
cially, they have certain requirements.

First,  you  must  be  able  to  interact  with  the  subject(s)  of
the  skill. They  must  be  aware  of  you  and  able  to  under-
stand you. If they can’t hear or understand you for some
reason, you have a –5 circumstance penalty to your skill
check (see Circumstance Modifiers in The Basics).

Interaction  skills  work  best  on  intelligent  subjects,  ones
with  an  Intellect  rank  of  –4  or  better. You  can  use  them
on creatures with Int –5, but again with a –5 circumstance
penalty;  they’re  just  too  dumb  to  get  the  subtleties  of
your  point. You  can’t  use  interaction  skills  at  all  on  sub-
jects lacking one or more mental abilities. (Try convincing
a  rock  to  be  your  friend—or  afraid  of  you—sometime.)

If you don’t find a particular skill on the list, like climbing,
bluffing, or search, remember that each skill in MUTANTS &
covers a lot of ground. So, you’ll find climbing
isn’t its own skill, but is listed as part of Athletics, while
bluffing and search are under Deception and Investiga-
tion, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill
you think is most similar to what you’re looking for.

The  Immunity  effect  (see  the  Powers  chapter)  can  also
render characters immune to interaction skills.

You  can  use  interaction  skills  on  groups  of  subjects

GOALS

How would you describe your hero’s personality? While
heroes  tend  to  share  a  desire  to  use  their  powers  for
good and uphold the law, they also show a diverse range
of attitudes. One hero may be dedicated to the ideals of
truth,  justice,  and  equality  while  another  is  a  vigilante
willing to break the law in order to ensure justice is done.
Some heroes are forthright and cheerful while others are
grim and unrelenting. Consider your hero’s attitudes and
personality traits. Don’t overlook the effect of Motivation
on  your  hero’s  personality  and  vice  versa  (see  Motiva-
tion, previously).

Finally, what are your hero’s goals? All heroes want things
like peace and justice to one degree or another, but what
other  things  does  your  hero  want?  One  hero  may  want
to  find  his  long-lost  family  while  another  may  want  to
avenge a terrible wrong done to her in the past. A mon-
strous or alien hero may seek acceptance and a new home
on Earth, while a teen hero may want to live up to the leg-
acy of a mentor or predecessor. Giving your hero a goal
beyond simply “doing good” can help give the character
more  depth  and  provide  opportunities  for  roleplaying
and complications during the game. Don’t overlook it.

The Gamemaster awards heroes power points at the end of each MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS story. This represents the experi-
ence and confidence the heroes have gained, along with other factors contributing to an improvement in their abilities,
skills, and powers.

Generally, heroes each receive 1 power point for a successfully completed adventure that lasts for one game session.
If the heroes overcame especially powerful foes or difficult challenges, the GM can increase the power point award to
2 points. For adventures lasting more than one game session, the heroes should get 1 power point per session, plus a
possible power point at the end if they did particularly well.

Gamemasters may vary the rate of advancement by awarding more power points per adventure, allowing heroes to
increase in power faster, which may suit certain styles of play. The Gamemaster also may choose not to award a power
point for an adventure in which the heroes did especially poorly, such as failing to defeat a villain’s major scheme or al-
lowing many innocent people to suffer harm they could have prevented.

Players can spend their heroes’ awarded power points in-betwee

a hero has Agility 6 and is trained in Acrobatics (with a rank
of 7) then the character’s bonus for checks involving feats
of agility covered by Acrobatics is 13 (6 plus 7). Obviously,
training in a skill makes characters more effective at checks
involving that skill, often much more.

For details on what skills are available and what they do,
see the Skills chapter.

Halfway between skills and powers, advantages are minor
benefits characters have, allowing them to do things oth-
ers cannot. They range from special combat maneuvers to
things like financial resources, contacts, and so forth.

Many advantages have no rank, or rather just one rank; a
character either has the advantage (and the benefits that
it grants) or does not. Other advantages may have multiple
ranks, like abilities and skills, measuring their effectiveness.

For details on the various advantages and what they pro-
vide, see the Advantages chapter.

When  using  the  Measurements  Table,  there  are  a  few
important things to keep in mind:

•

•

•

Each rank represents a range of measures. Time
rank  4  is  actually  all  measures  between  1  and  2
minutes, and time rank 16 is everything between 2
and 4 days! So if you’re looking for a measurement
that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one
that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than
8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance
rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).

Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.
In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed
14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds.
You can extend the negative side the Measurement
Table just like you can the positive side, with each
lower  rank  halving  the  previous  measurement.  So
rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3
inches, for example.

Don’t directly add ranks.  Putting  rank  4  distance
together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance!
Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6
is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements,
you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the
ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you
have different ranks, it is best to either handle them
separately  or  convert  them  to  measurements,  add
the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank
7 distance (around half a mile).

Time Rank = Distance Rank - Speed Rank

Reversing  the  previous  formula,  we  can  also  figure  out
how long it takes someone at a particular speed to cov-
er  a  given  distance,  by  subtracting  the  speed  rank  from
the distance rank to get a time rank. So a normal human
(speed  0)  walking  30  miles  (distance  13)  takes  about  16
hours. A hero with Speed 14 covers the same distance in
(13 – 14 = –1) just 3 seconds!

Throwing Distance Rank =
Strength Rank - Mass Rank

As  another  example,  the  distance  rank  a  hero  can  throw
something equals the hero’s Strength rank minus the mass
rank of the object. So a hero with Strength 10 (able to lift 25
tons), picks up a 10-ton truck (mass rank 9). Since 10-9=1,
the hero can then toss the truck rank 1 distance (60 feet)!

GAME PLAY

A session of the MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game resembles an issue of a comic book or an episode of an animated series.
The Gamemaster and the players get together and tell a story through the process of playing the game. The length of
the game session can vary, from just a couple hours to several hours or more. Some adventures may be completed in a
single session while others may take multiple sessions, just as some comic book stories are told in one issue while others
span multiple issues, forming a story arc or mini-series. The episodic nature of the game allows you to choose when to
stop playing and allows you to start up again at any time you and your friends want.

Also like a comic book, a M&M game consists of a series of interrelated scenes. Some scenes are fairly straightforward,
with the heroes interacting with each other and the supporting cast. In these cases the GM generally just asks the play-
ers to describe what their heroes are doing and in turn describes how the other characters react and what they do. There
may be some improvisational acting as everyone plays out the roles of their characters. When the action starts hap-
pening, such as when the heroes are staving off a disaster or fighting villains, time becomes more crucial and is broken
down into action rounds, and the players generally have to make die rolls to see how their heroes do.

CHECKS

Your hero stands perched on the rooftop, looking down
through the skylight. In the abandoned warehouse below,

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

HOOD: COMPLICATIONS AND UP-FRONT REWARDS

Some roleplaying game systems include complications, disadvantages, or similar problematic character traits which offer
“bonus points” for creating the character; essentially, you get more points for your character’s good traits when you take
on some bad ones.

The problem with such “up-front” rewards for giving a character flaws is that the player gets all of the reward (the bo-
nus design points) immediately, but the disadvantage only occasionally limits or affects the character, sometimes even
randomly. Since there is only so much “screen time” in a game session, there is virtually no way for the GM to spotlight
every one of every character’s disadvantages, so some end up being worth “more” in the sense of reward in exchange for
drawbacks. Plus, after they have “paid out” their initial benefit, front-loaded negative traits are nothing but a burden to the
character from that point forward, leading players to try and avoid or mitigate them as much as possible.

Complications address this issue by having a “pay-as-you-go” approach: if the GM uses a complication in the game, and
the player responds by going along with it, the player gets a reward in the form of a hero point. This means that although
the hero has to deal with some “bad stuff” from time to time, there is an upside, and a reason for players to want their
characters’ complications to come into play! Why do powerful heroes lead such complicated lived? They need the points!

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

When  this  happens,  and  poses  a  challenge  for  you,
your complication comes into play.

Prejudice: You are part of a minority group subject
to  the  prejudices  of  others,  which  create  problems.
Similarly, characters with unusual origins or appear-
ance might face prejudice, such as a demonic-look-
ing hero who is considered suspect. Some Gamemas-
ters and gaming groups may prefer not to deal with
issues of prejudice in their games, in which case the
GM is free to ban this complication.

Quirk:  Complications  can  often  come  from  various
personality  quirks:  likes,  dislikes,  hobbies,  neuroses,
and  so  forth.  For  example,  a  hero  might  have  the
quirk of always leaving some sort of “calling card” for
the authorities along with a captured criminal. That
could become a complication if somebody else starts
imitating it, or uses it to cause trouble for the hero.

not even on your turn. Reactions don’t count against your
normal  allotment  of  actions  and  you  can  react  as  often
as the circumstances dictate, but only when they dictate.

Heroes  run  into  their  share  of  difficulties  in  their  work.
One way MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS measures this is with dif-
ferent  conditions.  They  are  shorthand  for  the  different
game modifiers imposed by things from power effects to
injuries or fatigue. So, for example, “vulnerable” is a condi-
tion where a hero’s active defenses are reduced. An oppo-
nent grabbing them or an entangling mass of glue might
make heroes vulnerable, or they might be made vulner-
able by a foe’s cunning combat maneuver or being caught
off-guard. The game effect is the same (the hero’s active
defenses  are  reduced),  so  it  is  easier  to  just  refer  to  the
overall condition as “vulnerable” and describe the differ-
ent situations that cause it.

This section describes the different conditions that can af-
fect characters in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS. If multiple condi-
tions apply, use all of their effects. Some conditions super-
sede other, lesser, conditions, as given in their descriptions.

Each  basic  condition  describes  a  single  game  modifier.
They are the “building blocks” of conditions, much as ef-
fects  are  the  basic  building  blocks  of  powers.  Indeed,
many  power  effects  reference  these  basic  conditions  in

the descriptions of what they do. See the Powers chapter
for details.

Compelled: A compelled character is directed by an
outside force, but struggling against it; the character
is limited to free actions and a single standard action
per turn, with both types of action being chosen by
another, controlling character. As usual, this standard
action  can  be  traded  for  a  move  action.  Controlled
supersedes compelled.

Controlled:  A  controlled  character  has  no  free  will;
the character’s actions each turn are dictated by an-

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS Roleplaying Game allows you to create any sort of hero you want by choosing your character’s
abilities, skills, powers, and other traits. You have a “budget” of power points with which to build your hero. There are
also certain limits and guidelines imposed by the game’s power level, chosen by the Gamemaster, but within those
limits you can build a wide range of characters.

The quickest and easiest way to create your own MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero is to look through the various hero arche-
types on pages 35-49, choose one that fits the type of hero you want to play, and customize it to match your ideas. With
just a few quick choices, you have a new hero, complete and ready for the game!

Each archetype offers a complete, ready-to-play power level 10 hero, the recommended starting power level for MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS. Some archetypes offer a few simple choices in terms of skills, advantages, or sets of powers to fit different
themes. For example, many archetypes offer a choice of an Expertise skill to round out the character’s background and
interests outside of superheroism.

Some archetypes also offer an Options section, where you can change some of the pre-existing trait choices to create a
different kind of hero. For example, the Crime Fighter archetype has options for a hero with less equipment, but super-
human senses, or a special vehicle of some type. Other archetypes offer similar options.

Even if the archetype does not have an Options section that does not mean you cannot customize the archetype to suit
the type of hero you want to play! The archetypes are just starting points: if you are more familiar with character design
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, feel free to change any or all of your chosen archetype’s traits. So long as you stay within the
bounds of available power points, series power level, and your Gamemaster’s approval, you’re fine.

Please note, the characters on pages 35-49 include some Advantages in italicized print. Those advantages are from an
Enhanced Advantage effect listed in their powers.

Designing a hero from scratch in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS follows a series of simple steps, using the information presented
in the other chapters of this book. You’ll need a copy of the character sheet found in the back of the book (and also avail-
able online) and some scratch paper to design your character. If you’re pressed for time, looking for some inspiration,

appropriate type of check, a Difficulty Class, and make a
roll to see if the character succeeds or not! It’s that simple.

RANK

Every trait in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS —abilities, skills, pow-
ers, and so forth—has an associated rank, a value telling
you how strong (or weak) that trait is. Ranks run from –5
(very  weak)  all  the  way  up  to  20  (incredibly  strong)  or
more. You can rate virtually any trait by its rank. With the
correspondence of rank and measure, you can rate virtu-
ally  anything—distance,  weight,  time,  and  so  forth—by
rank.

Every  task—from  making  an  attack  to  avoiding  harm  to
figuring out a gadget—has a Difficulty Class or DC, a value
that tells you how hard that task is to perform. DCs range
from  0  (automatic,  so  easy  it’s  not  worth  rolling)  to  40
(nearly impossible).
CHECKS

Actions in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS are all resolved through
checks, a roll of a 20-sided die, plus a modifier. If the total
of the check equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class, the ac-
tion is a success. If it doesn’t, then it’s a failure.

Beneficial conditions apply a +2 bonus on the check (+5
for very highly beneficial), adverse conditions impose a –2
penalty (–5 for highly adverse). This is true whether you’re
trying to use a skill, make an attack, use a power, or what
have you.

Avoiding  an  effect  is  a  resistance  check,  with  a  Difficulty
Class of 10 + the effect’s modifier or rank. A successful re-
sistance means you avoid the effect, a failed check means
you suffer some (or all) of the effect.

THAT’S IT!

That’s the core of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS: roll d20 + rank and
modifiers vs. a Difficulty Class. If you understand that, you
can do pretty much anything in the game. The rest is just
detail. When in doubt, or whenever you want to speed the
game along, just have a player make a check of the appro-
priate trait rank against a DC based on how difficult the
task is and you can’t really go wrong.

Part of the Gamemaster’s job is to make sure the game
is fair and balanced, so everyone can have a good time
and all the heroes have an equal chance of doing some

255

fun and exciting things in the course of the adventure. It
can be tricky sometimes, but MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS gives
you  tools  for  balancing  the  traits  of  the  heroes  against
different  challenges  and  handling  problems  that  may
come up.

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

Heroes are more than just skilled, they often have amazing advantages, beyond the abilities of ordinary people. In MU-
MASTERMINDS, advantages often allow heroes to “break the rules,” gaining access to and doing things most people
cannot, or simply doing them better.

Advantages are rated in ranks and bought with power points, just like abilities and skills. Advantages cost 1 power point
per rank. Some advantages have no ranks and are acquired only once, effectively at rank 1.
Advantage Cost = 1 power point per advantage rank

Each advantage’s description explains the benefit it provides. It also says if the advantage can be acquired in ranks and
the effects of doing so. Such advantages are listed as “Ranked” alongside the advantage name. Ranks in a advantage are
noted with a number after the advantage’s name, such as “Defensive Roll 2” (for a character who has taken two ranks
in the Defensive Roll advantage), just like skill and power ranks. If there is a maximum number of ranks a character can
take, it’s listed in parentheses after the word “Ranked” in the advantage’s heading.

Advantages are categorized as one of four types:

•

•

•

•

Combat  Advantages  are  useful  in  combat  and  of-
ten modify how various combat maneuvers are per-
formed.

Fortune  Advantages  require  and  enhance  the  use
of hero points.

General Advantages provide special abilities or bo-
nuses not covered by the other categories.

Skill Advantages offer bonuses or modifications to
skill use.

Each advantage is listed by name, type, and if the advan-
tage is available in multiple ranks, followed by a descrip-
tion of the advantage’s benefits. The effects of additional
ranks  of  the  advantage  (if  any)  are  noted  in  the  text  of
each advantage. In some cases a advantage’s description
mentions  the  normal  conditions  for  characters  who  do
not have the advantage for comparison.

COMBAT

When you make an accurate attack (see Maneuvers, page
249) you can take a penalty of up to –5 on the effect modi-
fier of the attack and add the same number (up to +5) to
your attack bonus.

SKILL

You can use your Acrobatics bonus or movement speed
rank in place of Deception to feint and trick in combat as if
your skill bonus or speed rank were your Deception bonus
(see the Deception skill description). Your opponent op-
poses the attempt with Acrobatics or Insight (whichever
is better).

You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding

Immunity to various effects to gain immunity to them (with
more extensive effects requiring more ranks). These assign-
ments are permanent. Examples include the following:

•

1  rank:  aging,  disease,  poison,  one  environmental
condition  (cold,  heat,  high  pressure,  radiation,  or
vacuum), one type of suffocation (breathe normally
underwater or in an alien atmosphere, for example),
starvation and thirst, need for sleep, or a rare power
descriptor (such as your own powers, a close sibling’s
powers, etc.).

2 ranks: critical hits, suffocation effects (no need to
breathe  at  all),  or  an  uncommon  power  descriptor
(such as chemical, gravitic, necromantic, etc.).

5 ranks: alteration effects, sensory Affliction effects,
emotion  effects,  entrapment  (grabbing,  snares,  or
bonds), fatigue effects, interaction skills, or a particu-
lar  Damage  effect,  descriptor  (such  as  bullets,  cold,
electricity, falling, fire, magic, radiation, sonic, etc.)

10 ranks: a common power descriptor (such as all ef-
fects with cold, electricity, fire, radiation, or weather
descriptors,  for  example),  life  support  (includes  im-
munity  to  disease,  poison,  all  environmental  condi-
tions, suffocation, and starvation and thirst).

geoning or energy, for example).

30 ranks: All effects resisted by Fortitude, All effects
resisted by Will.

equivalent of 40 ranks of Impervious Toughness).

Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For exam-

MOVEMENT

Movement effects allow characters to get around in vari-
ous  ways.  Some  provide  a  speed  rank  with  a  particular
form of movement—such as ground, air, or water—while
others offer different modes of movement, like walking on
walls or slithering along the ground like a snake.

Although  activating  a  movement  effect  is  typically  a  free
action, the character must still take a move action in order
to actually move using the effect. So, for example, the ac-
tion of the Flight effect is “free” and activating it grants the
character a Flight speed rank equal to the effect rank. Mov-
ing that speed rank still requires a move action, however.

SENSORY

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  grouped  into  sense
types, descriptors for how different sensory effects work. The
sense types, and some of the senses included in them, are:

•

•

•

•

•

Visual: normal sight, darkvision, infravision, low-light
vision, microscopic vision, ultravision, X-Ray vision

Auditory: normal hearing, sonar (accurate ultrason-
ic), ultrasonic hearing

Olfactory: normal smell and taste, scent

Tactile: normal touch, tremorsense

Radio: radio, radar (accurate radio)

•  Mental: mental awareness, Mind Reading, Precogni-

Sensory effects enhance or alter the senses. Some senso-
ry effects improve the user’s senses while others grant en-
tirely new senses or fool the senses in some way. Sensory
effects are typically a free action to activate and sustain, or
are permanent and always in effect.

tion, Postcognition

Special: This is the catchall for other sensory descrip-
tors  not  given  above,  including  unusual  senses  or
exotic descriptors like cosmic, gravitic, magical, and
so forth.

Using  powers  is  a  fairly  simple  matter.  Some  power  effects  work  automatically.  Others—particularly  those  affecting
other people—require some effort to use, like an attack check or a effect check. Powers affecting others allow resistance
checks against their effects.

In  some  cases,  you  may  be  required  to  make  an  effect
check  to  determine  how  well  an  effect  works.  A  power
check  is  just  like  any  other  check:  d20,  plus  the  power’s
rank,  plus  any  applicable  modifiers,  against  a  difficulty
class set by the Gamemaster. The results of various power
checks are described in this chapter.

Presence: Creatures without Presence are unable to

Lacking an ability is –10 power points; that is, it gives the
character  an  additional  10  power  points  to  spend  else-
where,  similar  to  having  a  –5  rank  in  an  ability,  but  with
different  effects.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  heroes  cannot  be
absent an ability without Gamemaster permission, as it can
have significant effects on the character and the game.

Fighting: A creature with no Fighting is incapable of
making any sort of close attack (but may still be able
to launch ranged attacks, if it has Dexterity).

Absent abilities cannot be weakened (see the Weaken ef-
fect in the Powers chapter) or debilitated, since they are
not present at all in the first place!

Intellect: A creature with no Intellect is an automa-
ton, lacking free will and operating entirely on simple
instinct  or  pre-programmed  instructions.  Anything
with no Intellect is immune to mental effects and in-
teraction skills and has no Will defense.

their environment or capable of interaction), and Fighting

capable  of  independent  thought),  but  have  no  Stamina

change things to make the outcome more interesting or
more in line with how the game should go. In the above
example,  you  might  decide  the  villain  is  only  dazed  or
stunned  rather  than  being  knocked  out,  momentarily
giving the heroes the upper hand, but not ending the cli-
matic encounter prematurely.

Isn’t this cheating? Well, yes, in a manner of speaking it
is, but it’s “cheating” in order to make the game more in-
teresting and fun for everyone involved. So long as you
don’t alter the outcome of die rolls unfairly or malicious-
ly  and  you  do  it  to  help  ensure  the  game  is  fun,  inter-
esting, and challenging, you shouldn’t have a problem.
Besides,  the  complication  system  of  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
provides you with the perfect excuse to “cheat” to
help out the heroes’ adversaries from time to time, and
to  compensate  the  players  in  the  process  by  awarding
them hero points, which they, in turn, can use to “cheat”
the fickle die from time to time and ensure their heroes
succeed.

IT

Sometimes you’ll run into a situation the game rules don’t
cover, or that you’re not sure how to handle. In these cases,
feel free to just fake it. Come up with a check you feel suits
the situation and go with it, so you can keep the game mov-
ing rather than getting bogged down in page flipping and
rules arguments. One of the great things about the MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS system is pretty much everything can be re-
solved with a simple check. So when all else fails, just have a
player make a check with the most appropriate trait (ability,
skill, or power). If the check beats your estimation of the Dif-
ficulty Class, it’s a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure.

You also can fake it when dealing with certain trivial situ-
ations in the game. If there’s an important piece of infor-
mation you want the players to know, don’t bother seeing
if  they  succeed  at  a  Perception  check.  You  can  pretend
to  make  the  checks,  then  ignore  the  results  and  tell  the
players what their heroes find. Likewise,  if  a  power  level
10 hero is going to take out a PL 3 thug, you don’t have
to make all the rolls. Just ask the player to describe how
the hero defeats the hapless thug. It’s pretty much going
to  happen  anyway,  and  there’s  no  reason  why  the  hero
shouldn’t look cool doing it.

The essence of the MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game system is
actually  quite  simple.  The  vast  majority  of  th

PRINCESS

Julia wants to play a fairly straightforward hero: super-strong and tough, but also a beautiful
young woman with an eye for fashion! She draws a sketch of a smiling, slender woman in a

pink T-shirt that says “Princess” on it in silver sequins, holding a car over her head!

Right off, Julia knows Princess is strong, really strong. So she assigns her Strength 12;
higher than PL10, but still not so high that she can’t also have a reasonable close
combat bonus. That Strength is enough for Princess to lift a hundred tons! She

can heft that car with ease! Julia gives her Stamina 12 to match.

Since she sees Princess as graceful, like a gymnast, Julia gives her Agility
5, but she goes with Dexterity 3, since her character isn’t as coordinated
(although she’s still above average). Likewise, Julia assigns Princess 2 ranks
each  in  Intellect,  Awareness,  and  Presence;  she’s  smart,  sassy,  and  deter-
mined, but not amazingly so. Julia wants Princess to be a capable close-up
fighter, so she gives her Fighting 6. That’s a total of 44 ranks in abilities for 88

power points, leaving 62 remaining.

Next up: powers. Julia wants Princess to be fast and tough. She gives her 4 ranks of
Speed, allowing her to keep up with a slow-moving car, and assigns her 5 ranks in Im-
munity (allowing her to ignore cold, disease, heat, pressure, and radiation) along with some
Impervious Toughness (8 ranks) and Regeneration (2 ranks). That’s 19 points in powers,

43 remaining.

Given her great Strength and Agility, Julia also sees Princess as being able to jump re-
ally far, so she gives her 7 ranks in Leaping as well. That’s another 7 points, leaving 36.

Julia looks over the advantage list, taking notes as she goes. She likes the idea of
Princess being a real toughy: having things like Diehard and Ultimate Tough-
ness,  along  with  Interpose  (allowing  her  to  take  the  hit  for  a  teammate).
But she also wants her to be quick and inspirational. She likes Attractive,
Extraordinary  Effort,  Inspire,  and  Well-informed.  That’s  seven  advan-
tages thus far. She rounds out the list with some combat maneuvers
like All-out Attack and Power Attack (since Princess can cut loose if
she needs to), Improved Initiative (she’s quick) and another rank
of Inspire. That’s another four advantages, for a total of 11 points.

Julia  asks  the  Gamemaster  about  one  more  advantage:

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Although some heroes and villains rely solely on their skills and advantages, most are set apart by their superhuman
powers. MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS characters can lift tanks, fly through the air, throw lightning from their hands, shoot lasers
from their eyes, or any number of other amazing things. This chapter describes these and many other powers and how
you can create your own.

Players spend power points on various powers for their heroes, like acquiring skills or other traits. A power is made up of
one or more effects, possibly with different modifiers, which increase or decrease the cost of the effects.

Effects can be used to create any number of different powers. A hero with the Concealment effect (see page 153) could use
it to create a power called Blending, Blur, Cloak, Invisibility, Shadowmeld, or anything else appropriate to the character you
wish to play. It’s all a matter of how powerful the effect is and what modifiers have been placed on it to increase or decrease
its performance. Another way to think of it is that this book is filled with effects, but your character sheet is filled with powers.

Power  effects  are  acquired  in  ranks,  like  ranks  for  other
traits. The more ranks an effect has, the greater its effect.
Each effect of a power has a standard cost per rank.

MODIFIERS

Modifiers  change  how  an  effect  works,  making  it  more
effective  (an  extra)  or  less  effective  (a  flaw).  Modifiers
have ranks, just like other traits. Extras increase a power’s
cost while flaws decrease it. Some modifiers increase an
effect’s cost per rank, others apply an unchanging cost to
the power’s total; these are called flat modifiers. For more
information see Modifiers, on page 187.

The  final  cost  of  a  power  is  determined  by  base  effect
costs,  modified  by  extras  and  flaws,  multiplied  by  the
power’s rank, with flat modifiers applied to the total cost.

Power Cost = ((base effect costs + extras -
flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers

The rules in this chapter explain what the various powers do,
that is, what their game effects are, but it is left up to the play-
er and Gamemaster to apply descriptors to define exactly
what a power is and what it looks (and sounds, and feels) like
to observers beyond just a collection of game effects.

A power’s descriptors are primarily for color. It’s more inter-
esting and clear to say a hero has a “Flame Blast” or “Light-
ning  Bolt”  power  than  a  gene

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR
CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

From blaster rifles to anti-gravity belts, teleportation rings, and battlesuits, heroes and villains develop all manner of gad-
gets. Villains are forever coming up with doomsday machines and fiendish deathtraps while heroes use all sorts of gear
to aid them in their fight for justice. This chapter looks at various sorts of devices and equipment in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS
game terms. It also describes vehicles, headquarters, and constructs, ranging from zombie minions to giant robots.

DEVICES

A device is an item that provides a particular power effect or set of effects. While devices are typically creations of ad-
vanced science, they don’t have to be. Many heroes and villains have magical devices such as enchanted weapons and
armor, magical talismans, wands and staves of power, and so forth. Some devices are products of alien technology so
advanced they might as well be magical, or focuses of psychic or cosmic power beyond the understanding of both
magic and science. All devices work the same way in game terms, regardless of their origin or descriptors.

Generally speaking, devices are powers with the Removable flaw applied to them (see Removable in the Powers chapter),
meaning the power is external to the character. Take away the device, and the wielder loses the ability to use those powers.
So if an armored hero loses access to his battlesuit, for example, he also loses access to the powers tied-up in it. The same
is the case of a hero loses a cosmic ring, magic helmet, or alien artifact, which is why Removable is a flaw for those powers.

Just like other powers, devices cost power points (albeit reduced some by the Removable flaw). Characters who want to
have and use a device on a regular basis have to pay power points to have it, just like having any other power. The device
becomes a part of the character’s abilities. If the device is lost, stolen, or destroyed, the character can replace it, given
time, since the device is considered a permanent part of the character. Only a re-allocation of the character’s power
points will change this, and Gamemasters should allow characters to re-allocate power points spent on a Removable
power if it is somehow permanently lost.

In other cases, characters may make temporary use of a device. Most devices are usable by anyone able to operate
them, in which case characters may loan devices to each other, or may pick up and use someone else’s device (or even
steal a

The  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  Quickstart  Character  Gen-
erator found on the following pages first appeared as a
booklet  included  with  the  M&M  Gamemaster’s  Kit.  Our
goal in creating it was to make it easier for new players
and  Gamemasters  to  create  characters.  It  proved  very
popular and when we had the chance, we offered up the
idea  of  including  an  updated  version  of  it  in  the  Hero’s
Handbook to the fans and their response was a resound-
ing, “Yes!”

This updated version of the Quickstart Character Genera-
tor includes clearer instructions, some new powers and
options for some of the archetypes, and fixes to a couple
of the archetypes to make sure they didn’t break any of
the rules.

HEROES

The  character  generator  allows  players  to  quickly  create
power level 10 starting characters. Using these tables, new
players can start playing their new hero in mere minutes.
All they need to do is roll a d20 to find out what Archetype
they  get,  then  roll  on  the  tables  for  that  Archetype  and
write  everything  down  on  a  character  sheet  or  piece  of
paper and they’re set!

Sure, this method removes a lot of choice from the pro-
cess,  but  that  speeds  up  character  creation,  since  the
player doesn’t have to make every single decision along
the way (or even know the rules!). It can also provide some
much-needed inspiration to a player who doesn’t have a
strong idea for a new hero. Experienced players may not
need to randomly generate characters, but they may still
want to. The results from the random tables can be inter-
esting in ways a carefully conceived and planned charac-
ter is not.

Finally,  the  Gamemaster  can  use  these  tables  to  quickly
come up with a villain or NPC hero. Randomly roll a char-
acter or pick the Archetype and powers that best fit the
needs  of  the  story  and  within  moments  the  character  is
ready to go!

No  matter  how  Gamemasters  and  players  end  up  using
the Quickstart Character Generator, it should make starting
a game easier, faster, and more fun.

There are a few different ways to use the character gen-
erator.  Gamemasters  and  players  should  agree  on  the
method  they’re  using  before  beginning,  and  work  with
each  other  during  the  process  to  make  sure  the  end  re-
sult is agreeable. After all, you’re here to have fun, so your
main goal should be to ma

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

One player—the Gamemaster or “GM”—takes responsibility for running a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game. The Game-
master  creates  the  adventure,  runs  the  players  through  it,  takes  on  the  roles  of  the  various  other  characters  the
heroes encounter, and handles any questions about the rules as they arise. The Gamemaster also adjudicates the
process of character creation, deciding what traits, modifiers, and so forth are appropriate for the particular game,
along with the best way to express certain concepts in game terms. While Gamemastering is a big responsibility, it’s
not as hard as it might seem, and providing a fun and entertaining game for your friends can be quite rewarding.

While the players are responsible for keeping track of their characters and deciding on their actions, the Gamemaster is
responsible for everything else that happens in the game. A good GM tries to make sure the game runs as smoothly as
possible and is enjoyable for all of the players. Many components go into creating a good MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game.
The following sections give you the basics, but experience is the best tool to help you become a better Gamemaster.

can  be  broken  down  into  a  series
of tasks the heroes must perform, from piecing together
clues  about  a  villain’s  latest  scheme  to  blasting  said  vil-
lain through a wall and disarming his doomsday device in
the nick of time. It’s up to the Gamemaster to assign the
difficulty of these and numerous other tasks in the game
and to determine the outcome of the heroes’ efforts. This
section  offers  some  general  guidelines  on  assigning  the
difficulty of a task.

THE 55% RULE

tract 10 from the DC. So a DC 25 action (a formidable task)
requires a bonus of +15 in order to have a 55% chance of
success (on a roll of 10 or higher).

Keep in mind that this chance of success on a task allows
a character to automatically succeed at that task as a rou-
tine  check  (see  Routine  Checks,  following,  and  in  The
Basics chapter). This is intentional; the average character
only really fails at an average task when hurried or under
stress. A 55% chance also allows a player to spend a hero
point to automatically succeed, since a hero point ensures
a die roll of at least 11. (See Hero Points, page 20.)

A good guideline to keep in mind is the chance of an aver-
age character (with a modifier of 0) succeeding

You’re trained with a particular type of close attack, giv-
ing  you  a  bonus  to  your  attack  checks  with  it  equal  to
your  skill  rank  (see  Attack  Check  in  The  Basics  and  in
the  Action  &  Adventure  chapter).  Each  close  attack  is
a separate Close Combat skill with its own rank, and en-
compasses  a  single  weapon  or  power,  although  an  ar-
ray may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster’s
discretion  (see  Arrays  in  the  Powers  chapter  for  more
information).

A  successful  DC  10  Athletics  check  allows  you  to  swim
your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the
check fails, you make no progress through the water dur-
ing the action. With more than one degree of failure, you
go  under.  If  underwater,  you  must  hold  your  breath  to
avoid drowning (see page 238).

So  a  hero  might  have  Close  Combat:  Swords,  but  Close
Combat: Melee Weapons is too broad. Close Combat: Un-
armed  is  an  option,  meaning  skill  with  unarmed  strikes
like punches and kicks. However, this bonus does not ap-
ply to other forms of unarmed combat maneuvers, includ-
ing, but not limited to, grabbing or tripping.

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

be “recovered” in some fashion, such as recharging, rest,
repair, reloading, and so forth. The GM decides when and
how a faded effect recovers, but it should generally occur
outside of combat and take at least an hour’s time. The GM
may  allow  a  hero  to  recover  a  faded  effect  immediately
and completely by spending a hero point.

usable only in certain situations and those usable only on
certain  things.  For  example  Only  While  Singing  Loudly,
Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against
Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth. As a gen-
eral rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to
qualify  for  this  modifier.  Anything  less  limiting  is  better
handled as an occasional complication.

FEEDBACK

-1 COST PER RANK

You suffer damage when a manifestation of your effect is
damaged. This  flaw  only  applies  to  effects  with  physical
(or  apparently  physical)  manifestations,  such  as  Create,
Illusion,  or  Summon,  for  example.  If  your  power’s  mani-
festation  is  damaged,  make  a  resistance  check  against
the attack’s damage rank, using your effect’s rank as the
resistance check bonus. For example, if a manifestation of
a rank 10 effect is attacked for damage 12, you must make
a resistance check against damage 12 with a +10 bonus
(the effect’s rank) in place of your normal Toughness.

GRAB-BASED

-1 COST PER RANK

An attack effect with this flaw requires you to successfully
grab a target before using the effect (see Grab, page 248).
This generally applies to an effect that is close range, since
you have to be in close combat to grab anyway. If the ef-
fect’s default range is not close, apply the Close modifier
as well. If you do not succeed on the grab, you cannot use
the effect. If your grab attempt succeeds, the effect occurs
automatically as a reaction.

Example: Lamprey has a draining touch that is a
Grab-Based  Weaken  Strength  effect.  So  the  mon-
strous  villain  has  to  take  a  standard  action  and
make a grab first in order to use it. If his close attack
check hits, the target makes a Dodge or Fortitude
resistance  check  against  Lamprey’s  Strength.  If  it
fails, the target then makes the Fortitude resistance
check against the villain’s Weaken effect to see how
much Strength Lamprey drains away.

This  flaw  is  essentially  a  form  of  Resistible,  with  a  grab
check rather than a regular resistance check (see the Re-
sistible flaw for more).

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

181

SNARE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Extra  Condition,
Resisted by Dodge, Limited Degree • 3 points per rank

You can restrain a target with bonds of ice, glue, web-
bing, bands of energy, and so forth (whatever suits your
descriptors). The target makes a Dodge resistance check
against your effect DC. One degree of failure leaves the
target hindered and vulnerable, while two results in the
target becoming defenseless and immobilized. There is
no additional effect for three or more degrees of failure.

The resistance check to break out of a Snare is based on
Damage (including Strength Damage) or Sleight of Hand,
either breaking the effect or slipping out of it. This is part of
the power’s Alternate Resistance, with no change in cost.

Mental Link: You  have  a  mental  link  with  your  minions,
allowing you to communicate with them and issue orders
telepathically like the Communication Link effect (see the
Senses effects in this chapter). Flat +1 point.

Multiple  Minions:  You  can  summon  more  than  one
minion. Each application of this extra doubles your total
number of minions. So, for example, with Summon 6, you
summon a single 90-point minion. With Multiple Minions
1, you can summon two 90-point minions, with Multiple
Minions  2,  four  minions,  and  so  forth.  It  requires  a  stan-
dard action to summon each minion unless you also have
the Horde extra (see previous). +2 cost per rank.

STRIKE

Effect: Damage • 1 point per rank

You  inflict  additional  damage  in  close  combat.  Your
Strike  either  substitutes  for  your  Strength  damage  or
adds  to  it,  if  it  is  Strength-based,  see  the  Damage  ef-
fect for details. It might be claws, energy fields, focused
striking  strength,  or  something  similar,  depending  on
your  descriptors.  Close  combat  weapons  are  either
equipment or this power with the Removable flaw. See
the Gadgets & Gear chapter (following) for more infor-
mation.

Sacrifice: When you are hit with an effect requiring a resis-
tance check, you can spend a hero point to shift it to one
of your minions instead. The minion must be within range
of the effect and a viable target. Needless to say, this is not
a particularly heroic ability. In fact, the GM may wish to re-
strict  it  to  villains  or  non-player  characters  (in  which  case
a hero earns a hero point when a villain uses this extra to
avoid an effect by sacrificing a minion). Flat +1 point.
