RANGE

Each  effect  has  a  default  range,  which  may  be  changed
by modifiers.

•

•

•

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

DURATION

so.  If  you  are  incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  ac-
tion, or simply choose not to, the effect ends.

Sustained: You can keep a sustained effect going by
taking  a  free  action  each  round  to  do  so.  If  you  are
incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  action,  or  simply
choose not to, the effect ends.

* = See individual descriptions for more information.

Trucks  include  pick-ups,  sport  utility
vehicles (SUVs), vans, and similarly
sized vehicles.

Tanks are heavily armed
and  armored  vehicles.
The standard tank has
Tough-
Impervious
ness  12  and  comes
equipped  with  a  can-
non  (Ranged  Damage  10,
Burst Area 6) and a heavy machine
gun (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6). It
takes a move action to get into or out
of a  tank, and another move action
to start it up.

APCs or Armored Personnel Car-
riers,  are  designed  for  carry-
ing  troops.  They  come  with
a  smaller  cannon  (Ranged
Damage  6,  Burst  Area  4),
Impervious  Toughness  8,
and are set up so soldiers on
board can fire their personal
weapons  from  behind  the
cover of the APC’s armor.

Water vehicles range from small boats and outboards to
massive sea-going ships.

Cutters are used by the Coast Guard and the Navy. They’re
often equipped with light machine guns (Ranged Multiat-
tack Damage 6).

Destroyers  are  main  naval  ships,  carrying  heavy  guns
(Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area 8).

Battleships have massive gun batteries (Ranged Damage
13, Burst Area 9) and heavy armor.

Submarines are equipped with torpedoes (Ranged Dam-
age  8,  Burst  Area  5)  and  often  ballistic  missiles  (Ranged
Burst  Area  Damage  15  or  higher,  not  included  in  listed
cost).

Air vehicles are all capable of flight, some of them at very
high speeds.

Military  helicopters  are  equipped  with  machine  guns
(Ranged  Multiattack  Damage  6)  and  rockets  (Ranged
Damage 9, Burst Area 6).

Fighter  jets  have  machine  guns  (Ranged  Multiattack
Damage  6)  and  air-to-air  missiles  (Ranged  Damage  11,
Burst Area 8, Homing 6).

Bombers may have machine guns and missiles, but also
have powerful bombs (Burst Area Damage 12 or higher)
they can drop on targets.

Space  vehicles  are  intended  for  use  outside  the  atmo-
sphere, some of them for interplanetary or even interstel-
lar travel. Generally space vehicles are found in the pos-
session of alien civilizations, although the GM may choose
to allow some organizations and individuals on Earth to
have space vehicles.

Space fighters are armed with blaster cannons (Ranged
Damage 10).

Space cruisers have larger beam weapons (Ranged Dam-
age 12) and often energy torpedoes (Ranged Damage 12,
Burst Area 10, Homing 8).

Space  battleships  have  the  most  massive  weapons:

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Lady  Liberty,  rescuing  people  from  a
tenement  fire,  is  hemmed-in  by  collapsed  debris.
Her player decides to simply punch a path through.
Since  she’s  going  for  maximum  damage,  she  de-
cides  to  make  the  attack  check  normally  (rather
than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she’ll
only miss on a natural 1 anyway. She succeeds and
does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic
critical. The GM decides the brick, mortar, and heavy
beams have a toughness of 9 and makes a Tough-
ness  check,  rolling  a  5,  against  a  DC  30  (Lady  Lib-
erty’s Damage +15). A 14 result is three degrees of
failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and
clears the building, carrying people to safety!

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

Living targets remove one damage condition per minute
of  rest,  starting  from  their  worst  condition  and  working
back. So a damaged character recovers from being inca-
pacitated, then staggered, dazed, and finally removes a –1
Toughness check penalty per minute until fully recovered.
The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications  (see  Lasting Injuries  in  the  Recovery section
of the Action & Adventure chapter).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

The headquarters is equipped with an automatic system
for  detecting  and  extinguishing  fires.  Any  large  open
flame  sets  the  system  off  (beware,  fire-using  heroes!).  It
functions as a Nullify Fire 5 effect. A computer-controlled
fire prevention system can be programmed to ignore cer-
tain sources of fire or the system can be placed on manual
control (requiring someone to throw a switch in order to
activate it).

GARAGE

A garage houses ground vehicles and includes a ramp, el-
evator, or other access to move vehicles in and out, facili-
ties for repairing and maintaining vehicles, and a sliding
access door.
GROUNDS

In addition to the actual building(s) of the headquarters, it
has a considerable area of land surrounding it. An HQ can
have  surrounding  land  of  one  size  category  larger  than
the structure at no cost, without having this feature. Hav-
ing it allows for grounds up to three size categories larger
than the structure, so a large mansion headquarters could
have a colossal area of land.

If the headquarters has features like Defense System and
Security System, they also extend over the grounds (with
fences, sensors, weapon emplacements, and so forth).

GYM

A  gym  consists  of  weight-training  and  other  exercise
machines,  space  for  working  out,  stretching,  and  similar
exercises, and all the necessary amenities (lockers, show-
ers, etc.). Some HQs may incorporate the gym feature into
the combat simulator, for a multi-purpose training room.
A gym may also include a pool (heated or unheated, good
for  aquatic  characters),  possibly  even  connected  to  an
outside  body  of  water,  to  the  base’s  dock,  or  both  at  no
additional cost.

HANGAR

A hangar houses air and space vehicles. It includes a hatch
and/or runway for the vehicles to launch and facilities for
repairing and maintaining flying vehicles. For some HQs
the launch facilities of the hangar may require a long tun-
nel or other access to the outside.

These are cells for holding prisoners, usually temporarily,
although  some  headquarters  might  have  more  perma-
nent holding facilities. The cells are equipped with Nul-
lify devices (ranked at the HQ power level) or their basic
Toughness is increased by 50%, which option should be
agreed  upon  by  both  player  and  GM  (both  options  for
two  features).  Heroes  use  holding  cells  to  contain  cap-
tured villains until th

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

HOOD: SUPER-SHIELDS

Just as power armor is a device version of otherwise or-
dinary equipment armor, some heroes (and, less often,
villains) have shield devices providing them with great-
er benefits than an ordinary shield.

A shield device may provide Enhanced Dodge and Parry
defenses  like  a  mundane  shield,  or  it  can  grant  ranks
of  Protection  (which  do  stack  with  other  effects,  since
they’re not from equipment), perhaps even Impervious
Protection  for  a “bulletproof”  or “indestructible”  shield.
Such benefits are typically Sustained in duration, requir-
ing some action on the shield-wielder’s part.

A super-shield might even be useful as a weapon, pro-
viding a Damage effect, probably Strength-based. This is
best handled as an Alternate Effect of the shield, mean-
ing you can’t use it both offensively and defensively at
the same time! A hero able to hurl a shield at foes can
even have a Ranged Damage effect with it.

Chain-mail: A shirt of heavy metal chain, often with a coif

sentient magic item. They cannot undertake physical ac-
tions on their own, although they may be able to control
other  constructs.  They  cannot  move  or  exert  force,  and
automatically  fail  Strength  and  Agility  checks.  They  can
have Dexterity, used for manipulating remotes and such.

A construct can buy up one of its nonexistent ability ranks
by spending power points; +1 rank per 2 power points, as
usual, but starting at a rank of –5. This gives the construct
the normal use of that ability. Note a construct with Intel-
lect  but  no  Presence  is  intelligent  but  non-sentient  (not
self-aware) and a construct needs a rank in both Strength
and  Agility  to  be  able  to  move  and  act  physically.  Con-
structs cannot buy Stamina, since creatures with Stamina
are, by definition, not constructs.

Like inanimate objects, constructs have a Toughness rank,
which measures their ability to resist damage. A construct
starts out at Toughness 0 and can increase its rank using
the Protection effect. A mobile construct can even have
the Defensive Roll advantage.

SKILLS

Constructs can have skills just like characters at the same
cost.  However,  constructs  cannot  have  skills  based  on
abilities they lack.

Constructs can have advantages at the same cost as other
characters. Some advantages are less useful or even use-

less to constructs and, like skills, constructs cannot have
advantages requiring abilities they lack.
POWERS

Constructs can have various power effects, like other char-
acters. Some effects are less useful or even useless to con-
structs  and  the  GM  has  final  say  as  to  whether  or  not  a
particular effect can be assigned to a construct. Power ef-
fects are often aspects of a construct’s makeup or design,
such as built-in armor (Protection), weapons (Damage), or
sensors (Sense).

SIZE

Constructs larger or smaller than medium must pay pow-
er points for Innate and Permanent Growth or Shrinking.

A construct’s owner can give it orders verbally or through
any other means the construct understands. Command-
ing a construct is a move action. Constructs follow orders
to the best of their ability. Non-intelligent constructs do
exactly  as  they’re  told,  without  creativity  or  initiative,
while  intelligent  constructs  have  the  ability  to  interpret
and improvise. An owner can also give a construct a series
of basic orders for it to fulfill, such as “stay and guard this
place and attack anyon

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

+/-2 for bonus/penalty
+/-5 for major bonus/penalty

Sometimes  characters  work  together  and  help  each  other
out. In this case, one character (usually the one with the high-
est bonus) is considered the leader of the effort and makes
the check normally, while each helper makes the same type
of check using the same trait(s) against DC 10. The helpers’ in-
dividual degrees of success (and failure!) are added together
to achieve the final outcome of the assistance.

Success grants the leader a +2 circumstance bonus. Three
or more total degrees of success grant a +5 circumstance
bonus.  One  degree  of  failure  provides  no  modifier,  but
two or more impose a –2 circumstance penalty!

The GM sets the limit on how many characters can help as
part of a team check. Regardless of the number of help-
ers, the leader’s bonus cannot be more than +5 (for three
or more total degrees of success) nor the penalty greater
than –2 (for two or more total degrees of failure).

Team Check = +2 circumstance bonus
for one total degree of success
+5 circumstance bonus for three or more total degrees of success
-2 circumstance penalty for two or more total degrees of failure

An  attack  check  determines  whether  or  not  you  hit  an
opponent  in  combat  with  an  attack.  It  is  a  d20  roll  plus
your bonus with that particular attack, usually based off
of  Fighting  or  Dexterity  and  appropriate  modifiers,  like
the Close and Ranged Combat skills. The difficulty is your
target’s  defense  class:  Parry  for  close  attacks,  Dodge  for
ranged attacks. Certain attacks may target other defenses.
If  you  equal  or  exceed  your  target’s  defense  class  result,
your attack hits. Otherwise, you miss.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus +
modifiers vs. defense class

A natural 20 on an attack check (where the die comes up
20) always hits and may be a critical hit (see Critical Hits in
the Action & Adventure chapter). A natural 1 on an attack
check (where the die comes up 1) always misses, regardless
of the check total. This differs from normal checks and re-
flects the variable and unpredictable nature of combat.

A  resistance  check  is  an  attempt  to  resist  different  ef-
fects, ranging from damage and injury to traps, poisons,
and various power effects. A resistance check is a d20 roll
+  the  appropriate  defense  (typically  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, or Will).

Resistance Check = d20 + defense bonus +

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Captain  Thunder  has  the  ability  to  hurl
thunderbolts  that  shock  their  targets  with  electric-
ity and deafen them with powerful claps of thunder.
This  is  a  Ranged  Damage  effect  (lightning),  cost-
ing 2 points per rank, Linked to a Ranged Affliction
(deafening thunder), costing 2 points per rank. The
combined effect costs 4 points per rank.Since both
effects  are  ranged  and  require  a  standard  action
to use, so does the combined effect. Since Damage
requires a Toughness check and Affliction requires a
Dodge check, the target checks against them sepa-
rately, making a Toughness resistance check against
the damage of the lightning and a Dodge check to
avoid being deafened by the thunder. Since the two
effects are Linked, Captain Thunder cannot throw a
lightning  bolt  without  the  deafening  thunderclap,
nor can he attempt to merely deafen a target with-
out  also  hitting  them  with  lightning!  (To  do  these
things,  Cap  might  take  the  stand-alone  effects  as
Alternate Effects.)

+1 COST PER RANK

A Multiattack effect allows you to hit multiple targets, or a
single target multiple times, in the same standard action.
Multiattack  can  apply  to  any  effect  requiring  an  attack
check. There are three ways in which a Multiattack effect
can be used:

To  use  a  Multiattack  against  a  single  target,  make  your
attack check normally. If successful, increase the attack’s
resistance check DC by +2 for two degrees of success, and
+5  for  three  or  more. This  circumstance  bonus  does  not
count against power level limits.

If  an  Impervious  Resistance  would  ignore  the  attack  be-
fore any increase in the DC, then the attack still has no ef-
fect as usual; a volley of multiple shots is no more likely to
penetrate Impervious Resistance than just one.

You can use Multiattack to hit multiple targets at once by
“walking” or “spraying” the Multiattack across an arc. Roll
one  attack  check  per  target  in  the  arc. You  suffer  a  pen-
alty to each check equal to the total number of targets. So
making a Multiattack against five targets is a –5 penalty
to each attack check. If you miss one target, you may still
attempt to hit the others.

by  your  covering  attack  at  the  cost  of  being  automati-
cally  attacked  by  it;  make  a  normal  attack  check  to  hit
that opponent.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

EQUIPMENT

In addition to their amazing devices, characters often make use of various mundane equipment—ordinary things found
in the real world—ranging from a simple set of tools to cell phones, laptop computers, and even common appliances.
These items are known as equipment to differentiate them from devices.

EQUIPMENT

Equipment  is  acquired  with  points  from  the  Equipment
advantage. Each piece of equipment has a cost in points,
just  like  other  traits.  The  character  pays  the  item’s  cost
out of the points from the Equipment advantage and can
thereafter have and use that item.

An  item’s  cost  is  based  on  its  effects  and  features,  just
like a power (see the Powers chapter for more informa-
tion), so a ranged weapon has a cost based on its Ranged
Damage  rank.  Equipment  often  provides  the  Features
effect,  including  some  specific  equipment  Features  de-
scribed in this chapter. Indeed, some items of equipment
provide only Features.

Just as with power effects, there is a diminishing value in
having multiple items with a similar function, or a single
piece of equipment with multiple functions, usable only
one at a time. Equipment can have the Alternate Effect
modifier (see the Extras section of the Powers chapter),
such as a weapon capable of different modes of opera-
tion, or a reconfigurable tool.

Characters can also have Alternate Equipment, an array of
items usable only one at a time. This is typically a multi-
function  item,  or  a  kit  or  collection  of  various  smaller
items. The  classic  example  is  the  utility  belt  (see  its  de-
scription  later  in  this  chapter).  Alternate  Equipment  can
also  include  things  like  an  arsenal  of  weapons  the  char-
acter can swap out, providing different sets of weapons,
with only a limited number usable at once.

Characters may not necessarily carry all their equipment
with them at all times. The GM may allow players to spend
a hero point in order to have a particular item of equip-
ment “on-hand” at a particular time. This is essentially an
equipment  “power  stunt”—a  one-time  use  of  the  item
for  one  scene—and  the  Gamemaster  rules  whether  or
not having a particular item on-hand is even possible. For
example, a hero out for an evening in his secret identity
might have something like a concealed weapon or other
small item on-hand, but it’s unlikely the character is carry-

Choose  the  skill  ranks  you  want  your  character  to  have
and pay 1 power point per 2 total skill ranks. See the Skills

6. ADVANTAGES

Choose the advantages you want your character to have
and pay 1 power point per advantage or rank in a advan-
tage. See the Advantages chapter for details.

7. POWERS

Create  your  hero’s  powers  by  choosing  their  desired  ef-
fects  and  paying  the  effects’  base  cost,  adjusted  for  any
modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks. See the
Powers chapter for details.
8. COMPLICATIONS

Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can
have more, if you want, and the more complications your
hero  faces,  the  greater  your  chances  for  earning  hero

points during the game. See the Complications section
of this chapter for details.
9. DETAILS

Go  through  the  limits  listed  under  Power  Level  in  this
chapter and make sure your hero’s traits all fit within them.
If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.

Go back through and add up the costs of your hero’s abili-
ties, defenses, skills, advantages, and powers. You should
end  up  with  a  figure  equal  to  the  starting  power  points
shown on the Starting Power Points table. If not, double-
check your math and either remove or add traits to your
character to reach the starting power point total.

Figure out things like your hero’s name, appearance, origin,
background, and motivation. If you can, consider creating a
sketch or detailed description of your hero’s costume.

10. GAMEMASTER APPROVAL

Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The
GM should check again to make sure your power points
are  spent  and  added  up  correctly,  your  hero  follows  the
power  level  guidelines  and  any  other  guidelines  set  for
the  series,  and  that  the  character  is  generally  complete
and  suited  to  the  overall  game.  Once  your  GM  has  ap-
proved, your new hero is ready for play!

You design a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero by spending pow-
er points on different traits. Each ability, skill, advantage,
power, and other trait has an associated power point cost.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

107

Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.

STRENGTH (STR)

INTELLECT (INT)

Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to
apply it. Your Strength rank applies to:

•

Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based
attacks.
How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).
The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.
Athletics skill checks.

•
•
•
STAMINA (STA)

Stamina  is  health,  endurance,  and  overall  physical  resil-
ience.  Stamina  is  important  because  it  affects  a  charac-
ter’s ability to resist most forms of damage. Your Stamina
modifier applies to:

•
•

•

Toughness defense, for resisting damage.
Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your
character’s health.
Stamina  checks  to  resist  or  recover  from  things  af-
fecting  your  character’s  health  when  a  specific  de-
fense doesn’t apply.

AGILITY (AGL)

Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coor-
dination. Your Agility rank applies to:

•

•
•
•

Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and oth-
er hazards.
Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.
Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.
Agility  checks  for  feats  of  coordination,  gross  move-
ment, and quickness when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

DEXTERITY (DEX)

Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  hand-eye  coordination,  preci-
sion, and manual dexterity. Your Dexterity rank applies to:

•
•
•

Attack checks for ranged attacks.
Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.
Dexterity  checks  for  feats  of  fine  control  and  preci-
sion when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

FIGHTING (FGT)

Fighting  measures  your  character’s  ability  in  close  com-
bat, from hitting a target to ducking and weaving around
any counter-attacks. Your Fighting rank applies to:

•
•

Attack checks for close attacks.
Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.

Intellect covers reasoning ability and learning. A character
with a high Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and
well-educated. Your Intellect modifier applies to:

•

•

Expertise,  Investigation, Technology,  and Treatment
skill checks.
Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-
power when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

AWARENESS (AWE)

While  Intellect  covers  reasoning,  Awareness  describes
common sense and intuition, what some might call “wis-
dom.” A character with a high Intellect and a low Aware-
ness may be an “absent-minded professor” type, smart

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

mined by its rank, as given in its description.

TRANSFORM

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2-5 points per rank

You can change objects into other objects, altering their
shape  or  material  composition  in  the  process. You  must
touch  the  chosen  object,  which  requires  a  close  attack
check if the object is held or worn by another character.

What you can transform affects cost per rank:

•

2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one
other thing or substance, such as metal into wood,
iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.

Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands
of a cunning player. To a degree, Transform can dupli-
cate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by
transforming air into a solid material or turning oxygen
into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). This is perfectly
allowable; use the rules for other effects as guidelines
on how to handle these situations, using Transform rank
to determine resistance DCs.

Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained
duration, which may affect how such “tricks” work (e.g.,
the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffo-
cating gas dissipates unless the character concentrates
each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always,
the GM should use common sense and good judgment.

You  may  wish  to  require  characters  using  Transform
to  acquire  money  (gold,  precious  gems,  etc.)  or  other
permanent  material  goods  to  spend  power  points  on
ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain imperma-
nent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter
in your series in some way.)

It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects:
turning a steel door into water, air, or even rust certain-
ly  removes  it  as  a  barrier.  However,  keep  in  mind  that
Transform  is  normally  sustained;  the  target  isn’t  truly
destroyed unless the effect is continuous, and therefore
irreversible. Even then, the destruction of targets tends
to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of wearing-
down  and  eventually  destroying  objects,  use  Weaken
Toughness instead.

Transforming living or otherwise animate beings as op-
posed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than
Transform. To alter a target’s outward appearance only,
go  with  a  Morph  Attack  (see  the  Morph  effect).  For  a
harmful effect that does something like turn the target

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Heroes in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS cover a diverse range of power levels, from the first costumed adventurers of the Golden
Age, who relied solely on their skills and a few gimmicks (and modern vigilantes of the mean streets, who do much the
same), to the greatest protectors of the world, who take on cosmic threats on a regular basis. The following are some com-
mon power levels and starting power point values suitable for different M&M games:

LEVEL 8 - MASKED ADVENTURERS

This power level fits the “Mystery Men” era of the Golden Age of comic books, as well as for teams of mostly non-powered
adventurers: heroes who rely more on their skills and wits (and maybe a few gadgets) rather than amazing powers. The sug-
gested starting value of 120 power points creates well-rounded heroes at this level, particularly if the emphasis is on skills
and advantages—and maybe a power or two—rather than a lot of powers. Think Dr. Tomorrow and Foreshadow rather than
Captain Thunder and Daedalus. A higher starting power point total allows for more diverse capabilities within the same limits.

Heroes at this level often focus more on skill than sheer damage output, often having fighting skills in the 10–12 range,
but commensurately lower damage and effect ranks (using just their fists or small arms).

LEVEL 10 - SUPER HEROES

The suggested starting power level for MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS suits mature and experienced “adventurers” of the previous
level along with a wide range of younger or focused superhumans. This is the power level of the Sentinels, characters like
Bowman and Seven, and a great many of other heroes. It’s also good for powerful, but relatively inexperienced heroes like
Megastar when he first joined the Next-Gen.

Power level 10 heroes may have a balance of attack and effect, defense and resistance, or may go for being stronger on
one side than the other, having great combat skill, but comparatively limited damage, for example, or great Toughness,
but lowered defenses.

LEVEL 12 - BIG LEAGUES

Power level 12 is where you find many of the members of the current Freedom League: Daedalus, Lady Liberty, and the
Raven, to name a few. They are “senior” heroes, usually with considerable capabilities (and, often, experience). Those lacking
superhuman powers (such as the Raven) have amazing levels of skill and resources to draw upon while the superhuman
types are often among the most capable in

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

It’s that simple. Note that, practically speaking, a major cir-
cumstance modifier effectively shifts a check up or down
a  degree  of  difficulty,  as  shown  on  the  Difficulty  Class
Examples  table.  Likewise,  a  major  modifier  effectively
changes the degree of a graded check by one (see Grad-
ed Checks in Chapter 1).

Routine checks reflect that some tasks and situations are
so  trivial  it  is  not  worth  having  a  player  roll  a  check.  It
would be illogical for the character to have a real chance
of failing at the task, since failure should be rare enough
to constitute a complication in that situation. Examples in-
clude things like a competent driver handling a car under
ordinary conditions or a trained professional performing
the routine tasks of a job.

Routine checks save time, because you do not need to ask
players  for  a  check  for  every  single  thing  their  characters
do, but they also provide valuable guidelines for when you
should ask the players for a check while running the game.
They  set  a  threshold  for  the  Difficulty  of  certain  actions.
When coming up with Difficulty Classes for your adventure,
keep the routine check rule in mind. If the DC is low enough
that anyone can succeed as a routine check, then it may be
too low, or the action may not be worth assigning a check.

Take Perception, for example. If you decide it is a DC 10
Perception  check  to  pick  up  on  some  clue  or  bit  of  in-
formation in the adventure, that Difficulty is low enough
that anyone with an unimpaired (0 or higher) Awareness
can succeed at the task as a routine check. Assuming the
information is also important to the plot, you might be
better off to simply tell the players their characters no-
tice  it  without  calling  for  a  check.  If  there  needs  to  be
a  chance  of  failure,  then  set  a  higher  Difficulty  for  the
check. Of course, If the situation is stressful—such as the
midst of combat—then a routine check is not an option,
and  a  lower  DC  can  provide  heroes  with  a  reasonably
high chance of success with just a small chance of failure
for dramatic purposes.

“TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENS...”

Sometimes  it’s  a  good  idea  to  make  checks  secretly,  so
the players don’t necessarily know the result. This is usu-
ally  the  case  for  any  sort  of  check  where  the  characters
don’t  immediately  know  whether  they’ve  succeeded  or
failed. For example, Perce

Powers  based  off  the Variable  effect  are  obviously  very  flexible,  capable  of  duplicating  a  wide  range  of  other  effects.
Responsibility for controlling Variable effects in the game is placed largely in the hands of both the Gamemaster and
responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with numerous game-system limitations
that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of effects.

Keep in mind a Variable effect is not supposed to be “any effect I want.” That kind of unlimited power doesn’t belong in the
hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A Variable effect can be “any effect within a
given set of parameters,” but it’s up to you and the GM to define those parameters. The limits of power flexibility in MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS are deliberately set by Variable effects, the use of extra effort, and hero points.

Many  comic  book  heroes  who  appear  to  have  the  power  to “do  anything”  are  actually  using  one  of  these  options  in
terms.  For  example,  a  super-wizard  can  do  practically  anything  with  magic.  However,  generally
speaking, these characters have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with power points) and
“stunts” they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly hero points).
This is why the Magic power given later in this chapter, for example, is not a Variable effect: most powers in the game
have the potential to do “stunts” via extra effort, so the “variability” of Magic seen in the comics is already built-in to the
system, with some costs to control it, without having to give players carte blanche to duplicate any effect in the game at
will (which is just likely to slow things down and cause game balance issues).

Variable effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and define everything about a given power in
advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an application of the Morph effect with a long
list of Metamorph options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at a time, would be tedious to say the
least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A Variable effect, with the descriptor “animal
forms” is easier to manage. The player can pre-build certain commonly used animal forms for use during play, but also ha

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

You can use combinations of advantages—particularly combat advantages—to create different “fighting styles” rang-
ing from martial arts to superhero combat techniques. For example, a “soft” fighting style focusing primarily on defense
might include the advantages Defensive Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Trip, and Instant Up. A “hard” fighting style
focused on offense might include All-out Attack, Improved Critical, Improved Smash, Power Attack, and Startle for a fierce
kiai shout! You can combine various advantages to create specific styles or allow players to mix-and-match to design their
own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet
mastered a style may have only some of a style’s associated advantages rather than all of them.

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

Startle.

Sword-fighting: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Taunt.

•  Wrestling: Chokehold, Fast Grab, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Power Attack.

Comic book martial artists often have abilities far beyond the scope of the advantages and fighting styles given in this
chapter. Such superhuman martial arts abilities as leaping vast distances, punching through solid stone, shrugging off
damage, and killing with a mere touch are powers. See the Powers chapter for details.

bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to both your
active defenses (Dodge and Parry).

COMBAT, RANKED

You can avoid damage through agility and “rolling” with
an  attack. You  receive  a  bonus  to  your Toughness  equal
to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active de-
fense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in
the  Abilities  chapter),  so  you  lose  this  bonus  whenever
you  are  vulnerable  or  defenseless. Your  total Toughness,
including this advantage, is still limited by power level.

This advantage is common for heroes who lack either su-
perhuman speed or toughness, rely

means your attack hits automatically, since the target has
no defense bonus, and the routine check overcomes the
normal difficulty.

If  you  choose  to  make  your  attack  check  normally
(against DC 10), then a successful hit is treated as a criti-
cal hit, with a +5 circumstance bonus to the attack’s re-
sistance DC. Additionally, if you hit with a damaging at-
tack with intent to kill, and the target’s resistance check
has three or more degrees of failure, the target dies im-
mediately.

When you make an attack you can take a penalty of up to
–2 on your attack bonus and add the same number (up to
+2) to the effect bonus of your attack. Your attack bonus
cannot  be  reduced  below  +0  and  the  effect  bonus  can-
not more than double. The changes to attack and effect
are  decided  before you  make  your  attack  check  and  last
until the start of your next turn. This maneuver does not
apply to effects requiring no attack check or allowing no
resistance check.

When you charge, you can charge right into your target,
using  your  momentum  to  strengthen  your  attack,  but
potentially receiving some damage from the impact your-
self. The damage rank for your attack equals your move-

ment  speed  rank,  or  your  normal  damage  rank,  with  a
+1 circumstance bonus, whichever is higher. If you move
your full speed before you charge, increase your damage
by either means by an additional +1 circumstance bonus.
The Gamemaster may limit your base slam attack damage
(before  applying  circumstance  modifiers)  by  the  series
power level.

Example:  Slingshot  flies  into  a  foe,  moving  at
speed  rank  10.  His  unarmed  damage  (Strength)
rank is only 2, so he uses his speed rank of 10 for the
damage. Since he also moved his full speed to build
up momentum, he increases his damage by +1 for
a total damage rank of 11. If a base damage rank
of 10 is too high for the series, the GM may impose
a  lower  limit  on  Slingshot’s  slam  attack  damage,
applying the +1 modifier for the full speed move to
the lowered rank.

You suffer some of the impact of slamming into a target;
make a Toughness resistance check against half the dam-
age rank of your attack (rounded down).

Example: Slingshot hits his target, and must make
his own Toughness resistance check against dam-
age rank 5: his slam attack damage of 11, divided
by 2, which equals 5.5, rounded down to 5. Fortu-
nately,  Slingshot’s  helmet  provides  him  with  an

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

Whether it’s an underground cave, the top floors of a skyscraper, a satellite in orbit, or a base on the Moon, many heroes
and villains maintain their own secret (or not so secret) headquarters. Teams may even pool their equipment points to
have a headquarters they share, with the Gamemaster’s approval.

A character can even have multiple bases of operation (see Alternate Headquarters later in this section). This is more
common for villains, who have back-up plans and secret bases they can retreat to when their plans are defeated. If a
character’s headquarters is destroyed, the character can choose to rebuild it or build a new headquarters with different
features using the same equipment points. Supervillains often go through a succession of different lairs.

Headquarters  have  two  main  traits—Size  and  Tough-
ness—and a number of possible Features. Each of these
costs equipment points.

SIZE

A structure’s size is measured similarly to that of a vehicle,
and gives a general idea of the overall space it occupies
and how much space is available inside it. See the Struc-
ture Size Categories table for guidelines. A headquarters
starts out at Small size for 0 points. Each increase in size
category  costs  1  point,  each  decrease  in  size  category

TOUGHNESS

A  headquarters’  Toughness  indicates  the  strength  of  its
structural materials, particularly its outer structure (walls,
ceiling, etc.). A structure starts out with Toughness 6 for 0
points. +2 Toughness costs 1 equipment point.

Some  features  refer  to  a  headquarters’  power  level.  For
player characters, this is the power level of the series over-
all.  For  non-player  characters,  particularly  villains,  this  is
the base-owner’s effective power level, or whatever pow-
er level the GM wishes to set, using the series power level

the  round  in  which  the  duration  ends.  So,  for  example,
an instant duration Affliction only lasts one round, while
a  sustained  duration  Affliction  lasts  until  no  longer  sus-
tained. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Degree: Your Affliction is limited to no more than
two degrees of effect. With two applications of this modi-
fier, it is limited to no more than one degree of effect. –1
cost per rank.

BURROWING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel be-
hind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a
speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Bur-
rowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground
at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard
clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank.
Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional
ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or
collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you
begin burrowing each new tunnel).

Note  that  Burrowing  differs  from  the  Permeate  effect  of
Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle
like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing
it at all (see Movement for details).
EXTRAS

Penetrating:  Normally,  the  hardness  of  the  ground  af-
fects  only  the  speed  at  which  you  burrow.  At  the  GM’s
discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered
Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows
you to dig through them. 1 point per rank.

Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a
greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of
the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Oth-
ers, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone
else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of
the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Limited:  Burrowing  may  be  limited  to  certain  circum-
stances  or  materials,  such  as  only  loose  sand  and  soil

BLAST

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You  can  make  a  damaging  ranged  attack.  It  might  be
a  blast  of  energy,  a  projectile  (arrow,  bullet,  throwing
blade, etc.), or some similar effect. You make a ranged
attack  check  against  the  target’s  Dodge  defense.  The
attack’s damage equals your power rank and the target
makes a Toughness resistance check against it.

Armor: Armor provides Protection for a vehicle in addi-
tion to its normal Toughness, possibly including Imper-
vious  Protection.  Some  vehicles  may  have  Sustained
Protection (such as force screens) instead of, or in addi-
tion to, Permanent Protection. 1 point per +1 Toughness.

Cloaking Device: A vehicle may have a “cloaking de-
vice” granting Concealment from visual senses. Some
vehicles  may  also  have  Concealment  from  auditory
senses or things such as radar, giving them a “stealth
mode.” 4 points (normal vision or all of another sense
type) or 8 points (all visual senses).

Immunity:  Vehicles  normally  provide
immunity
to  the  normal  hazards  of  environments  they  travel
through—such  as  underwater  or  in  space—at  no
additional  cost.  Additional  Immunity  effects  are  for
unusual hazards or circumstances, such as a car that
provides  a  sealed  air  system,  granting  immunity  to
suffocation and other atmospheric hazards.

Smokescreen:  The  vehicle  can  release  a  cloud  of
thick smoke or mist that provides an Area visual Con-
cealment Attack to hide the vehicle or confuse pur-
suers. 12 points.

•  Weapons:  Vehicle  weapons  are  based  on  various
attack  effects,  particularly  Damage  with  various
modifiers. Vehicles, especially military vehicles, may
mount versions of some of the weapons listed else-
where in this chapter.

A team of heroes may share a vehicle used by the whole
team, particularly useful for shuttling around team mem-

bers  who  cannot  fly  or  move  at  super-speed. The  mem-
bers of the team divide the equipment point cost of the
vehicle among them as they see fit, devoting the neces-
sary  ranks  of  the  Equipment  advantage  to  covering  the
vehicle’s cost.

Just like Alternate Equipment, characters may have mul-
tiple  vehicles. These  are  generally  Alternate  Equipment
by  definition,  since  it’s  difficult  to  drive  or  pilot  more
than one vehicle at a time! So the character pays the full
cost  for  the  most  expensive  vehicle,  and  then  1  equip-
ment point for each additional vehicle with the same or
lesser cost.

So a hero with an array of vehicles, such as a plane, boat,
and  car  pays  full  equipment  point  cost  for  the  most  ex-
pensive  of  the  vehicles  and  just  1  equipment  point  for
each  of  the  others.  The  hero’s  player  can  even  spend  a

Archetypes), a hero with more sheer power than skill (like
the Powerhouse), or a hero who is a roughly equal mix of
both (like the Warrior) who are all within the series limit,
PL10. The same is true of the various other traits, such as
placing a greater reliance of Dodge and Parry over Tough-
ness, or vice versa.

The  GM  may  want  to  keep  an  eye  on  combinations  that
swing wildly towards one side or another: the hero with no
Dodge/Parrry bonus to speak of but a massive Toughness
bonus,  or  the  one  with  no  real  attack  bonus  but  capable
of  dishing  out  a  tremendous  amount  of  damage.  For  the
most part, these designs are self-limiting, but they can pose
problems in comparison to better-balanced heroes. A dis-
parity of more than 50% between a pair of power level lim-
ited traits is something to look at closely before approving.

CHARACTERS

While the GM should keep the power level guidelines and
suggested  starting  power  points  of  the  series  in  mind
while  creating  villains  and  members  of  the  supporting
cast, non-player characters are not restricted by the series
power level and are built on as many power points as the
GM wants to give them. In other words, there is no need
to add up the “cost” of a non-player character. Just assign
the appropriate traits at the desired ranks.

Determine  an  NPC’s  effective  power  level  based  on  the
character’s  highest  appropriate  offensive  and  defensive

trait(s).  This  power  level  is  simply  an  approximation  to
show what level of challenge that NPC offers, and is not
necessarily related to the NPC’s power point total, which
may be greater than or less than the recommended start-
ing power points for that power level.

Example: The Gamemaster is creating a villain for
a power level 10 series. The bad guy has a +8 total
attack bonus with a primary attack doing 16 dam-
age. Adding these together and dividing by 2 gives
the GM a power level of 12 [(16 + 8)/2]. So long as
none of the villain’s other traits exceed this, the GM
notes the villain’s power level as 12, a reasonable
challenge for a group of PL10 heroes.

Normally a hero’s traits are fixed. Once power points are
spent  on  them,  they  remain  there.  In  some  cases,  how-
ever,  the  Gamemaster  may  allow  players  to  re-allocate
their  characters’  points,  changing  their  traits  within  the
limits of the series power level, perhaps even losing some
traits and gaining entirely

EXTRAS

Area: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets
in the affected area. You spend only one hero point, but
the subjects are each affected individually. You must ap-
ply the same effect to all subjects at once. +1 cost per rank.

Luck: Each rank in this extra gives you the benefit of a rank
in the Luck advantage (see Luck in the Advantages chap-
ter). It is subject to the same limits as the Luck advantage
set by the GM. Flat +1 point per rank of Luck.

Selective: This extra, applied to Area Luck Control, allows
you to choose who in the area is or is not affected by it. +1
cost per rank.

FLAWS

Action: If the action required for Luck Control is increased
beyond a reaction, it is only usable during your turn each

Effect:  Perception  Ranged  Damage,  Resisted  by  Will  •
4 points per rank

You can strike targets’ minds with “mental force,” inflict-
ing  Damage  resisted  by  the  target’s  Will  rather  than
Toughness, but having no effect on targets immune to
effects resisted by Will, such as inanimate objects. Men-
tal Blasts are often, but not always, Subtle as well, which
costs a flat 1 point.

MAGIC

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You are a sorcerer, witch, or wizard, able to cast a variety
of magical spells. Your basic default effect is a Blast of
eldritch  force,  able  to  inflict  Ranged  Damage  (see  the
Blast power, previously).

However,  like  the  Energy  Control  power,  Magic  can
have a wide range of Alternate Effects, each a separate
spell you have mastered. The possibilities are virtually
limitless, within the bounds of your hero’s descriptors
and  the  Gamemaster’s  approval.  Examples  include
mystic  bindings  (Affliction,  see  the  Snare  version),
dispelling  magical  effects  (Nullify  Magic),  conjuring
clouds of mist or fog (an Area Visual Concealment At-
tack), scrying distant places (Remote Sensing), or slip-
ping  between  the  dimensions  to  appear  elsewhere
(Teleport), to name just a few.

All Magic effects have the “magic” descriptor regardless
of their other descriptors, so a Blast of flames conjured
with magic has both the “magic” and “fire” descriptors,
for example.

Magicians  often  have  a  Power  Loss  complication  (see
Complications  in  The  Basics  chapter):  if  they  are  un-
able to freely speak and gesture to cast their spells, they
cannot  use  Magic  (or  any  related  magical  powers  reli-
ant on spellcasting). Certain styles of Magic may impose

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

The  exception  is  Toughness,  which  can  only  be  increased
above your base Stamina rank using advantages and pow-
ers, not by direct spending of power points. This reflects that
greater-than-normal Toughness is virtually always some sort
of special ability. See the Advantages and Powers chapters
for various options for improving Toughness, notably the De-
fensive Roll advantage and the Protection effect.

Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to
be fully effective. Limits on your mobility, focus, and reac-
tion time adversely affect them. If you are vulnerable, your
Dodge  and  Parry  defense  ranks  are  halved  (divide  their
normal values by 2 and round up), and if you are defense-
less, they are both reduced to 0!

One  use  of  defenses  is  determining  a  defense  class,  or
the  difficulty  class  to  affect  a  target  with  a  particular  at-
tack. This  is  the  appropriate  defense,  plus  10,  just  like  a
routine  check  (indeed,  it  is  essentially  a  measure  of  the
character’s “routine” defense). So hitting a character with
a ranged attack goes against Dodge defense, giving the
attack a DC of (Dodge + 10). Similarly, affecting someone
with a mental power goes against Will defense, with a DC
of (Will + 10), and so forth. This is referred to as “targeting”
a defense, such as “targets Dodge” or “targets Will”.

The main defense class traits are Dodge, Parry, and Will.

Defenses  are  also  used  to  measure  the  ability  to  over-
come certain effects, involving a resistance check of the
defense plus a die roll against a difficulty class determined
by the effect or hazard. So you might make a Fortitude re-
sistance check for your hero to overcome a toxin, for ex-
ample, or a Dodge resistance check to avoid a trap just as
it is triggered, and so on. This is referred to as “resisting,”
such as “resisted by Fortitude” or “resisted by Dodge”.

The  main  resistance  check  traits  are  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, and Will.

When  things  start  happening  quickly,  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
characters use their initiative bonuses to determine
who goes first. Each character involved in a conflict makes
a check of d20 + initiative modifier, which is:

Initiative Modifier = Agility + Advantages
(Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers

Characters then act in initiative order, from highest to low-
est. For details see the Action & Adventure chapter.

EXTRAS

Affects Objects: Weaken with this modifier works on inani-
mate objects, although the effect can still only affect traits
the objects possess. This is most often applied to Weaken
Toughness  for  an  effect  that  can  weaken  both  creatures
and objects. +1 cost per rank, +0 for Affects Only Objects.

Broad: You can Weaken any of a broad set of traits, one at
a time suited to your effects descriptors. So you might be
able to Weaken Abilities, for example, or Weaken Mental
Effects. You choose which trait from the set is weakened
when you use the effect. +1 cost per rank.

Concentration: Once you have hit with a Concentration
Weaken, so long as you continue to take a standard action
each turn to maintain the effect, the target must make a
new resistance check against it, with no attack check re-
quired. +1 cost per rank.

Incurable: Weaken with this modifier cannot have its ef-
fects  countered  by  another  power  (such  as  Restorative
Healing) without the Persistent modifier; the target must
recover from the Weaken normally. Flat +1 point.

MODIFIERS

Precise: A Weaken effect capable of reducing more than one
trait at once can have this modifier, allowing you to choose
which traits are affected, while not affecting others. Note this
differs from the Selective extra (following). Flat +1 point.

Progressive:  A  Progressive  Weaken  effect  reduces  the
affected  traits  each  round  until  the  target  successfully
resists. Make a new resistance check for the target at the
end of each turn; failure weakens the affected trait(s) fur-
ther, while success stops the Progressive Weaken, but the
target must still recover ranks already lost (at the rate of 1
point per turn). +2 cost per rank.

Selective: This extra is applied to an Area Weaken so it only
affects some targets and not others. Combined with Precise
(previously), you can use an Area Weaken to selectively af-
fect only certain traits of certain targets. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous: If applied to a Broad Weaken, this extra al-
lows it to affect all of the traits in its set at the same time.
Each trait loses the difference between the resistance check
result and the DC in power points on a failed check. So a

use  perception  ranged  effects  via  your  Remote  Sensing.
Despite the built-in limitation, this is an extra, since it al-
lows you to use your Remote Sensing to observe subjects
in relative safety. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous:  You  can  use  both  Remote  Sensing  and
your normal senses at the same time, perceiving two lo-
cales like “translucent” overlays of each other. This means
you’re more capable of taking physical action while also
using  your  Remote  Sensing,  although  the  effect  still  re-
quires its normal duration to maintain. You are not vulner-
able while using your Remote Sensing. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle: Remote Sensing already has a degree of subtlety. Ap-
plying 1 rank of Subtle to Remote Sensing increases the DC
to notice the effect to 20 + rank or makes it noticeable only to
a particular unusual sense (with the usual DC 10 + rank per-
ception check). Subtle 2 makes Remote Sensing completely
unnoticeable, as usual. Flat +1 point per rank of Subtle.
FLAWS

Feedback:  With  this  flaw,  damaging  attacks  directed  at
where you displaced your senses can affect you. Your sen-
sory-point is considered to have partial cover from attacks
and you use your Remote Sensing rank as your Toughness
defense against any successful attack. The feedback may
be psychosomatic in nature or due to some sort of disrup-
tion  caused  by  an  assault  on  the  point  where  you  have
redirected your senses. Note that sensory effects already
work on you via Remote Sensing and this flaw doesn’t ap-
ply to them. –1 cost per rank.

Medium: You  require  a  medium  for  your  Remote  Sens-
ing, such as shadows, flames, mirrors, open water, televi-
sion screens, and so forth. You can only perceive locations
where your chosen medium exists. –1 cost per rank.

Noticeable: Remote Sensing with this flaw has an easily
noticeable display, like a glowing set of eyes or a phantom
image of your face, head, or body at the location you are
observing. This manifestation cannot be used for commu-
nication, however (for that, take the Communication ef-
fect). Flat –1 point.

Sense-Dependent:  Remote  Sensing  is  already  Sense-
Dependent  and  cannot  apply  this  flaw.  Another  effect
might potentially have the flaw Remote-Sensing Depen-
dent, such as an Affliction that targets only remote view-
ers observing a target or an area as a means of blocking or
deterring them.

MYSTIC

The  Mystic  commands  vast  magical  powers  and  uses
them  to  defend  the  Earth  from  otherworldly  threats  as
well  as  to  combat  the  evils  found  just  down  the  street.
The  Mystic  typically  has  extensive  knowledge  of  magic
and other realms, but few real-world skills to speak of. The
magical powers the Mystic commands are nearly limitless,
allowing  the  Mystic  to  fire  blasts  of  magical  energy,  fly,
create  illusions,  heal  others,  travel  to  other  dimensions,
and reproduce virtually any other power imaginable.

Insulating Fur: You have a layer of fur that protects
you from intense heat and cold, giving you immunity
to those environments.

Internal Compartment: You can carry a portion of
your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a
pouch  or  compartment  of  some  sort,  able  to  hold
objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than
your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).

Iron  Stomach: You  can  eat  anything  that’s  not  toxic
without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be:
spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.

•  Mimicry: You can imitate almost any sound you’ve
heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks
to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.

The  Feature  effect  is  intended  to  round  out  various
minor traits and abilities characters might have, but it
is entirely optional and not meant to burden MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS character design with needless amounts
of detail. It’s for traits with an actual game effect, not
merely  descriptors  or  background  color  (neither  of
which should cost any points). Ultimately, the Game-
master  decides  what  traits  merit  a  rank  (or  more)  of
Feature and what Features are permitted for any given
game or setting, using the examples given here.

If  a  “feature”  is  something  likely  to  come  up  only
occasionally, or even just once, then you are better
off  allowing  it  as  an  aspect  of  the  inspiration  and
power  stunt  rules  (see  the  Characteristics  chap-
ter), charging the player a hero point for the feature
when it comes into play. The player can then choose
whether  or  not  to  use  earned  power  points  to  ac-
quire the Feature as a regular part of the character’s
traits later on.

DAMAGE

A successful attack with a Damage effect requires the tar-
get to make a Toughness resistance check.

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage,  the  target’s  condition  shifts  to  dying.  A  dying
target  who  fails  a  resistance  check  against  Damage  is
dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability
to hit things! You can apply effect modifiers to the Dam-
age your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even
an  Area  effect!  You  can  also  have  Alternate  Effects  for
your Strength Damage; see the Alternate Effect modi-
fier  for  details.  Like  other  Damage  effects,  a  character’s
Strength Damage is close range and instant duration by
default.

If you choose, a Damage effect can be Strength-based—
something like a melee weapon—allowing your Strength
Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and Damage
ranks together when determining the rank of the attack.
Any modifiers applied to your Damage must also apply to
your Strength rank if its bonus damage is to benefit from
them.  However,  any  decrease  in  your  Strength  reduces
the amount you can add to your Damage, and negative
Strength  subtracts  from  your  Damage!  Likewise,  any-
thing that prevents you from exerting your Strength also
stops you from using a Strength-based Damage effect. If
you can’t swing your fist, you can’t swing a sword, either.

You can inflict damage on a target by making a close at-
tack. The exact nature of your Damage is up to you, with
the GM’s approval; it can be anything from a powerful im-
pact to razor claws, energy fields, or some other damaging
medium. The target resists with Toughness:

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage, the target’s condition shifts to dying. A dying tar-
get who fails a resistance check against Damage is dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability

A  common  piece  of  equipment  for  crime  fighters  and
espionage agents is the utility belt (or bag, pouch, back-
pack, etc.): a collection of useful tools and equipment in
a compact carrying case. A utility belt is an array of Alter-
nate Equipment. Some characters may have a Removable
array of devices instead, allowing for far more unusual ef-
fects than run-of-the-mill equipment.

Note  that  equipment  with  a  cost  of  1  equipment  point
doesn’t  really  need  to  be  acquired  as  Alternate  Equip-
ment,  since  there’s  no  change  in  cost.  Still,  heroes  often
have 1-point items in their utility belts, like flashlights, re-
breathers, and so forth.

By spending hero points you can temporarily add Alter-
nate  Equipment  to  your  utility  belt,  for  those  one-time
items you may need in a pinch.

Feel  free  to  modify  this  example  (adding  or  omitting
items)  to  create  your  own  customized  utility  belts. The
tear gas, as the most expensive effect, has full cost. The
other items cost 1 point each for Alternate Equipment,
making the total equipment point cost of the utility belt
25  equipment  points,  or  5  power  points  (for  5  ranks  of
the Equipment advantage).

DEFENSE

A vehicle’s size determines its base Defense, which is used
to determine the Defense Class to hit the vehicle with at-
tacks. For sizes larger than medium, this is a penalty, mak-
ing it easier to target the vehicle, even to the point where
attackers  can  hit  it  as  a  routine  check. You  can “buy  off”
the Defense penalty applied to a vehicle for 1 equipment
point per –1 penalty removed.

TOUGHNESS

Size category determines a vehicle’s base Toughness rank,
used  for  Toughness  resistance  checks.  You  can  increase
a vehicle’s Toughness over the base rank for its size for 1
equipment point per Toughness rank.

Alarm: The vehicle has an alarm system that goes off
when an unauthorized access or activation attempt
is made. A Technology check (DC 20) can overcome
the alarm. For each additional equipment point, the
DC increases by 5.

Caltrops: A vehicle may be equipped with a dispenser
for caltrops, spikes meant to damage tired. Activating
the dispenser is a standard action. Caltrops automati-
cally blow out the tires of ordinary vehicles that run over
them  (consider  such  vehicles  “minions”).  Heroes  and
villains can make DC 13 Toughness checks for their ve-
hicles; tires are Toughness 3. One degree of failure slows
the vehicle, while two degrees of failure immobilize it.

Hidden  Compartments:  The  vehicle  has  hidden
compartments or cargo areas holding up to a tenth

usable only in certain situations and those usable only on
certain  things.  For  example  Only  While  Singing  Loudly,
Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against
Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth. As a gen-
eral rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to
qualify  for  this  modifier.  Anything  less  limiting  is  better
handled as an occasional complication.

FEEDBACK

-1 COST PER RANK

You suffer damage when a manifestation of your effect is
damaged. This  flaw  only  applies  to  effects  with  physical
(or  apparently  physical)  manifestations,  such  as  Create,
Illusion,  or  Summon,  for  example.  If  your  power’s  mani-
festation  is  damaged,  make  a  resistance  check  against
the attack’s damage rank, using your effect’s rank as the
resistance check bonus. For example, if a manifestation of
a rank 10 effect is attacked for damage 12, you must make
a resistance check against damage 12 with a +10 bonus
(the effect’s rank) in place of your normal Toughness.

GRAB-BASED

-1 COST PER RANK

An attack effect with this flaw requires you to successfully
grab a target before using the effect (see Grab, page 248).
This generally applies to an effect that is close range, since
you have to be in close combat to grab anyway. If the ef-
fect’s default range is not close, apply the Close modifier
as well. If you do not succeed on the grab, you cannot use
the effect. If your grab attempt succeeds, the effect occurs
automatically as a reaction.

Example: Lamprey has a draining touch that is a
Grab-Based  Weaken  Strength  effect.  So  the  mon-
strous  villain  has  to  take  a  standard  action  and
make a grab first in order to use it. If his close attack
check hits, the target makes a Dodge or Fortitude
resistance  check  against  Lamprey’s  Strength.  If  it
fails, the target then makes the Fortitude resistance
check against the villain’s Weaken effect to see how
much Strength Lamprey drains away.

This  flaw  is  essentially  a  form  of  Resistible,  with  a  grab
check rather than a regular resistance check (see the Re-
sistible flaw for more).

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

Now the remaining smugglers get to go. They draw their guns and shoot at you!

The GM rolls attack checks against the heroes. Two smugglers shoot at Ultramarine and three shoot at Princess, but they both
have Impervious Toughness 8. Since the smugglers’ guns can’t hurt them, the GM does not bother rolling the attack checks. The
remaining two shoot at Rook, but one is impaired and the other blind, so they both miss by a mile.

Rook, you easily avoid the clumsy shots, especially from the guys dazzled by the flash bomb. Princess, Ultramarine, a
couple of stray shots ricochet off of you harmlessly.
ROUND 2

That brings us back to the top of the order. Princess?

Princess: I’m going to punch-out one of the smugglers! “Hey, watch the couture, boys!”

GM: Roll an unarmed attack check.

Princess: Rolls, gets a natural 20. A critical hit!

GM: Glances at Princess’ Strength of 12, and the +5 critical hit DC modifier, making the Toughness resistance DC (15 + 12 + 5)
or 32. No way the smuggler can succeed.

Wow! You send the guy flying right off the deck and into the drink! Sploosh!

Then, suddenly…

The GM rolls an attack check against Princess, getting a 15 result. Normally this would miss her Dodge defense of 18, but this is
a surprise attack, so Princess is vulnerable and her Dodge is halved to 4, rather than 8, making the DC a 14.

…a steel mesh net launches out of the doorway of the control cabin of the ship. Princess, give me a Dodge resistance
check.

Princess: Rolls a 5 for a total of 13. Um… 13?

GM: Compares it against the DC of 19. Two degrees of failure.

…the net wraps around you tightly, leaving you immobilized and defenseless, Princess.

From out of the control cabin lumbers a massive armored figure in red and silver, one arm ending in a lobster-like servo-
claw.

Ultramarine: Trawler!

GM: In Trawler’s voice. Who did you think was running this operation, heroes? Now back off!

Ultramarine: Is it my turn?

GM: No. It would be, but you delayed until after Rook, remember? Rook, it’s your turn, then Ultramarine and the smug-
glers.

Rook: I don’t think my weapons will do much against Trawler’s armor. Can I help Princess get free from the net?

GM: Your throwing talons might help cut through it.

Rook: Okay, I’ll do that.

GM: Since the net is immobile, do you want to roll or make a routine check?

Rook: If I roll, I get a damage bonus, right? The GM nods. Okay, I’l

Items provided by the Equipment advantage (see the Advantages chapter) are essentially effects and other traits with Easily
Removable, along with the various other limitations outlined in the Gadgets & Gear chapter, amounting to a reduction of
–4 points per 5 power points of final cost. Thus the Equipment advantage provides 5 points worth of equipment per rank
(or 1 power point).

ture  to  find  certain  rare  parts,  specialized  help,  or  other
components.

SENSE-DEPENDENT

-1 COST PER RANK

For a flat 1-point reduction in the value of the Removable
flaw, you can define a device as Indestructible. It can still
be taken away, but cannot be damaged or destroyed, ex-
cept as a GM-imposed complication (earning the player a
hero point as usual). This reduction can lower the value of
the flaw to 0, in which case the character gets no power
point discount for the device.

The temporary loss of a removable power does not con-
stitute  a  complication,  any  more  than  the  result  of  any
other  flaw. You  can  have  a  device  or  power-object  as  a
descriptor without this flaw, if you wish, in which case the
power cannot be removed or taken away from you with-
out a complication applied by the GM (earning you a hero
point) or the use of an effect like Nullify, which has pre-
defined conditions for recovery.

-1 COST PER RANK

When applied to an effect that doesn’t normally allow a
resistance  check,  this  flaw  gives  it  one.  Choose  the  de-
fense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on
others  allow  a  resistance  check  by  definition,  this  nearly
always applies to personal effects that allow someone in-
teracting with them to circumvent the effect with a suc-
cessful check.

For  example,  an  Enhanced  Parry  defense  effect  might  re-
flect a low-level reading of a target’s mind to anticipate and
avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome
the effect, denying you the defense bonus against that op-
ponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your
Concealment  effect  might  be  illusory  rather  than  a  true
physical transformation, permitting a Will resistance check
for someone to overcome it. A sustained Protection effect
might be some sort of “kinetic field” that permits an attack-
er a Fortitude resistance check to overcome it.

When applied to an effect that does normally allow a re-
sistance check, this flaw gives it an additional one, which
may be the same as its normal

pass through solid objects permeable to your type of en-
ergy, but energy resistant barriers, like heavy shielding or
force fields, block your movement.
RANK 4 - INCORPOREAL

You  can  assume  a  less  solid  form,  with  each  Insubstantial
rank becoming progressively less solid. You do not gain the
ability to assume lower-ranked Insubstantial forms at higher
ranks, but you can acquire a lower-ranked form as an Alter-
nate Effect of a higher-ranked one. You can switch between
normal and Insubstantial form at will as a free action once
per  round.  The  default  is  that  substantial  is  your “normal”
form, but the GM may permit you to make Insubstantial your
“normal” form, in which case remaining solid is a sustained
duration for you! Insubstantial offers four ranks of effect:

You  become  an  incorporeal  phantom.  You  can  pass
through solid matter at your normal speed and you have
Immunity to Physical and Energy Damage. Sensory effects
(other than tactile) and those targeting Will still work on
you,  as  do  effects  with  the  Affects  Insubstantial  modi-
fier. Choose one other reasonably common effect or de-
scriptor that works on you while you are incorporeal. You
have no effective Strength and cannot affect the physical
world, except with effects with the Affects Corporeal mod-
ifier. Your sensory effects work normally.

RANK 1 - FLUID

You become a fluid mass. You can flow through any sort of
opening,  under  (or  around)  doors,  through  keyholes  and
pipes,  and  so  forth.  You  cannot  pass  through  watertight
seals. You can automatically flow out of any restraint—such
as a snare or grab—that is not watertight. So you cannot flow
out of a bubble completely enclosing you, for example, but
anything  less  cannot  hold  you. You  can  exert  your  normal
Strength and can still push or carry objects, although your
manual dexterity may be limited (at the GM’s discretion).

A  fluid  character  may  attempt  to  catch  a  falling  person
or  object,  cushioning  the  fall  with  the  character’s  flex-
ible  form. This  requires  a  move  action,  and  reduces  the
falling damage by the cushioning character’s Toughness
bonus (representing flexibility in this case). Both charac-
ters  must  make  resistance  checks  against  the  remaining
damage. Higher rank insubstantial forms—lacking physi-
cal Strength—cannot attempt this.

Audio  Recorder: These  tiny  digital  recorders  (about  the
size  of  a  deck  of  playing  cards)  can  record  up  to  eight
hours  of  audio  and  can  be  connected  to  a  computer  to
download the digital recording.

Video  Camera:  A  hand-held  camera  that  records  video
and audio on tape or digitally, with a capacity of about 6
hours of footage. Video cameras cost 2 points, since they
effectively double as audio recorders as well.

sion goggles must have at least a little light to operate. A
cloudy night provides sufficient ambient light, but a pitch-
black cave or a sealed room doesn’t. For situations of total
darkness, the goggles come with an infrared illuminator
that, when switched on, operates like a flashlight visible
only to the wearer (or anyone else with IR vision).

Parabolic Microphone: This apparatus has a gun-like mi-
crophone with an attached set of headphones. A parabol-
ic mike provides a +5 equipment bonus to listening Per-
ception checks that overcomes some or all of the penalty
for listening to sounds at a distance, through walls, etc.

This equipment is most often used by criminals or to catch
criminals.

Handcuffs: Handcuffs are restraints designed to lock two
limbs—normally the wrists—of a prisoner together. They
fit any medium or small humanoid. Handcuffs can only be
placed on a defenseless or unresisting target. Steel cuffs
have Toughness 9 and are DC 20 to escape using Sleight
of Hand (or Technology to pick the lock).

Lock Release Gun: This small, pistol-like device automati-
cally disables and opens cheap and average mechanical
locks operated by standard keys as a routine check. It does
not affect other locks.

Restraints: Similar to handcuffs are plastic restraints, used in
cases where authorities need to restrain a large number of
people and cuffs are impractical. They are generally Tough-
ness 5 or so and DC 20 to escape with Sleight of Hand but
cannot be removed except by cutting or breaking them.

Heroes often use surveillance gear to keep tabs on crimi-
nals and their activities.

Binoculars: Standard binoculars allow the user to make visu-
al Perception checks at a greater distance, or with a reduced
penalty  for  distance,  effectively  providing  a  +5  equipment
bonus that overcomes some or all of the distance penalty.

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: An artificial intelligence or
magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-
sessed Construct may recall enough of its former life
to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Construct may feel
that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

•

•

Enemy:  The  Construct  could  be  a  rogue  android,
golem,  or  summoned  elemental  hunted  by  its
creator(s)  or  another  person  or  group  who  believes
the Construct is evil for some reason.

•

Accident:  The  Mystic  commands  incredible  super-
natural powers, but sometimes those powers get out
of control, or awaken sleeping horrors, or cause other
unintended consequences that have to be dealt with.

Enemy: Some Mystics are plagued by enemies who
want to displace them or steal their power.

Honor:  It’s  not  uncommon  for  a  Mystic  to  follow  a
code of conduct that keeps them on the straight and
narrow,  perhaps  because  it’s  the  right  thing  to  do,
perhaps because they need to in order to keep their
powers in check.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Mystics  are  often  either
not from Earth or were trained in the mystic arts on
another  world. When  they  come  to  this  plane  they
use their talents to help others and hopefully earn a
place for themselves on their adopted world.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Mystic was given
his  or  her  power  for  a  reason—to  defend  Earth,  to
hunt down otherworldly creatures, or any number of
other options. Or perhaps the Mystic recognizes that
his or her power comes with a price.

•

•

Power  Loss:  Mystics  often  have  the  Complication
that  prevents  them  from  using  their  powers  when
they can’t move and/or speak to cast their spells.

Prejudice: Some Mystics are surrounded by an aura
of “otherness”  that  sets  them  apart  from  the  rest  of
humanity and makes it difficult for them to interact
with others. Or, maybe people just fear witches.

PARAGON

Paragons are what people first think of when they think
of superheroes. A Paragon is nearly perfect in every way:
fast, strong, tough, often has the ability to fly, and repre-
sents everything good about humanity. Paragons are of-
ten talented in a wide range of areas and easily take on
leadership roles.

Levitation: You can only move vertically, straight up and
down, and not side to side, although you can allow your-
self to be carried along in the direction of the wind hori-
zontally. –1 cost per rank.

Platform: Your Flight is reliant on some sort of platform on
which  you  stand  or  sit.  If  you  fail  a  resistance  check  while
flying,  or  you  are  grabbed  by  someone  standing  on  the
ground, you’re knocked or pulled off your platform and can-
not fly. You can regain the use of your flying platform by reac-
tivating your Flight effect on your next turn. –1 cost per rank.

Wings: You have wings that allow you to fly, but they run
the risk of being fouled or restrained, which prevents you
from flying. If you are immobilized, restrained, or bound,
you cannot fly. You can regain the use of your wings by
reactivating  your  Flight  effect  once  you  are  no  longer
affected  by  the  aforementioned  conditions.  –1  cost
per rank.

GROWTH

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily increase your size, gaining Strength
and  Stamina  at  the  cost  of  becoming  a  bigger,  heavier,
less agile target, unable to maneuver through small spac-
es. Growth modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

Each  rank  of  Growth  adds  1  rank  to  your  Strength  and
Stamina  (constructs  add  1  rank  to  Strength  and Tough-
ness if they lack Stamina) and adds 1 rank to your mass.
Every  two  ranks  adds  a  +1  bonus  to  Intimidation.  Every
8 ranks adds 1 to your Speed. Every rank of Growth sub-
tracts 1 from your Stealth checks. Every 2 ranks (rounded
up) subtracts 1 from your Dodge and Parry defenses. Ev-
ery  4  ranks  of  Growth  increases  your  size  rank  by  1  (or-
dinary humans start out at size rank –2, between 3 and
6  feet  tall).  So  at  Growth  8,  you  have  +8  Strength  and
Stamina,  +4  to  Intimidation,  +1  Speed,  but  -8  to
Stealth,  –4  Dodge  and  Parry,  and  you  are  size
rank 0 (around 30 feet tall). Increases to your
Strength and Stamina also improve related
traits like your Strength Damage, Forti-
tude, and Toughness.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

As with the Feature effect, a Feature extra should be sig-
nificant  enough  to  be  worth  at  least  1  power  point  and
not solely based on the power’s descriptors. So, for exam-
ple, a fiery Ranged Damage effect does not need a Feature
to ignite fires; doing so is part of its “fire” descriptor and
can be equally advantageous and problematic. A Ranged
Damage effect that consistently “brands” its target with a
visible and traceable mark, on the other hand, is an effect
with an added Feature.

HOMING

FLAT • 1 POINT PER RANK

This modifier grants a ranged effect an additional oppor-
tunity to hit. If an attack check with a Homing effect fails, it
attempts to hit again on the start of your next turn, requir-
ing only a free action to maintain and allowing you to take
other actions, including making another attack. Each rank
in Homing grants the effect one additional attack check,
but it still only gets one check per round.

The  Homing  effect  uses  the  same  accurate  sense  as  the
original attack to “track” its target, so concealment effec-
tive against that sense may confuse the effect and cause
it to miss. If a Homing attack misses due to concealment,
it  has  lost  its “lock”  on  the  target  and  does  not  get  any
further  chances  to  hit.  You  can  take  Senses  Linked  to
the Homing effect, if desired (to create things like radar-
guided or heat-seeking missiles, for example). If a Homing
attack  is  countered  before  it  hits,  it  loses  any  remaining
chances to hit. The same is true if it hits a different target.

+1 COST PER RANK

A defense with this modifier is highly resistant. Any effect
with a resistance difficulty modifier equal to or less than
half the Impervious rank (rounded up) has no effect. So,
for  example,  Impervious Toughness  9  ignores  any  Dam-
age with a rank of 5 or less. Penetrating effects can over-
come  Impervious  Resistance  (see  the  Penetrating  extra
description).

Impervious is primarily intended for Toughness resistance
checks, to handle characters immune to a certain thresh-
old  of  damage,  but  it  can  be  applied  to  other  defenses
with  the  GM’s  permission,  to  reflect  characters  with  cer-
tain reliable capabilities in terms of resisting particular ef-
fects or hazards.

+1 COST PER RANK

Effects have a standard duration: instant, sustained, con-
tinuous,  or  permanent.  See  Duration  at  the  start  of  this
chapter for details.

lows you to choose which are nullified and which are not.
Flat +1 point.

Randomize: Rather than being countered, the effect(s) tar-
geted by your Nullify acquire the Uncontrolled flaw and go
out of control (as dictated by the GM). +0 cost per rank.

Selective: If you have an Area Nullify effect, this extra al-
lows you to choose who in the area is affected, nullifying
some targets and not others. +1 cost per rank.

Sustained:  If  this  modifier  is  applied  to  Concentration
Nullify, keeping the countered effect(s) suppressed is only
a free action for you each turn. +1 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Side Effect: If you fail to nullify an effect, you might suffer
some kind of “backlash” or similar side effect. –1 cost per
rank.

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

Protection shields you against damage, giving you +1 to
your Toughness  defense  per  rank.  So  Protection  4  gives
you +4 Toughness.

FLAWS

Sustained:  Your  Protection  is  a  sustained  effect,  rather
than permanent. The effect can be turned on and off and
can be improved using extra effort, including using it to
perform  stunts  (see  Extra  Effort).  Sustained  Protection
might be a power like a personal force field, or the ability
to consciously harden your skin and turn it into armor. +0
cost per rank.

QUICKNESS

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  can  perform  routine  tasks—anything  that  can  be
done as a routine check (see Routine Checks in The Ba-
sics  chapter)—fast,  perhaps  very  fast.  Subtract  your  ef-
fect rank from the normal time rank to perform a task to
determine how long it takes you. So, for example, if you
have Quickness 7, a routine task normally taking an hour
(time rank 9) takes you (9 – 7 = time rank 2) 30 seconds.
Non-routine checks are not affected by Quickness, nor is
movement speed.

If you can perform a task in less than a second (time rank
–2), the GM may choose to treat that task as a free action
for you (although the GM can still limit the number of free
actions you can accomplish in a turn as usual).

FLAWS

Limited: You must specify a reasonably common effect
(or set of uncommon effects) that keeps you from recov-
ering from death, such as beheading, cremation, a stake
through the heart, and so forth. Even then, if the effect is
somehow removed or reversed (e.g. the stake is removed
from your corpse) you may still be able to come back. -1
cost per rank.

IMMUNITY

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding
on  any  resistance  check  against  them. You  assign  ranks  of
Immunity to various effects to gain immunity to them (with
more extensive effects requiring more ranks). These assign-
ments are permanent. Examples include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

1  rank:  aging,  disease,  poison,  one  environmental
condition  (cold,  heat,  high  pressure,  radiation,  or
vacuum), one type of suffocation (breathe normally
underwater or in an alien atmosphere, for example),
starvation and thirst, need for sleep, or a rare power
descriptor (such as your own powers, a close sibling’s
powers, etc.).

2 ranks: critical hits, suffocation effects (no need to
breathe  at  all),  or  an  uncommon  power  descriptor
(such as chemical, gravitic, necromantic, etc.).

5 ranks: alteration effects, sensory Affliction effects,
emotion  effects,  entrapment  (grabbing,  snares,  or
bonds), fatigue effects, interaction skills, or a particu-
lar  Damage  effect,  descriptor  (such  as  bullets,  cold,
electricity, falling, fire, magic, radiation, sonic, etc.)

10 ranks: a common power descriptor (such as all ef-
fects with cold, electricity, fire, radiation, or weather
descriptors,  for  example),  life  support  (includes  im-
munity  to  disease,  poison,  all  environmental  condi-
tions, suffocation, and starvation and thirst).

20  ranks:  a  very  common  power  descriptor  (blud-
geoning or energy, for example).

30 ranks: All effects resisted by Fortitude, All effects
resisted by Will.

•

80  ranks:  All  effects  resisted  by  Toughness  (the
equivalent of 40 ranks of Impervious Toughness).

Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For exam-
ple, “immunity to cold” can range from the environmen-
tal effects of cold (described under The Environment) to
cold damage, to complete immunity to all effects with the
“cold”  descriptor. The  first  requires  only  1  rank,  and  pro-

jects cannot have their selectivity changed once they are
created. +1 cost per rank.

Stationary:  Your  created  objects  can  hang  immobile
in  the  air. They  resist  being  moved  with  a  Strength  rank
equal to the modifier rank. Unless you have the Tether ex-
tra  or  the  Movable  extra,  you  cannot  move  a  stationary
created object once it’s placed any more than anyone else
can. +0 cost per rank.

Subtle:  This  modifier  either  makes  created  objects  not
noticeable as constructs for 1 rank (they look just like real
objects) or not noticeable at all for 2 ranks (such as objects
composed of invisible force). Flat +1or 2 points.

Tether: You  have  a  connection  to  your  created  objects,
allowing  you  to  exert  your  own  Strength  to  move  them
(provided you are strong enough to do so). Flat 1 point.
FLAWS

Feedback: You may suffer damage when your created ob-
jects are damaged (see the Feedback flaw description for
details). -1 cost per rank.

Permanent:  Permanent  created  objects  last  until  de-
stroyed or nullified. Unlike Continuous Create, you cannot
choose to dismiss such objects; they are truly permanent.
You  cannot  repair  permanent  created  objects  or  other-
wise alter them once they’re created. +0 cost per rank (for
a Sustained effect).

Proportional: Your  created  objects  have  a  total  volume
rank plus Toughness rank equal to your Create rank, rather

than both volume and Toughness up to your rank. So you
can create an object with volume rank 0 and Toughness
equal to your Create rank, vice versa, or anywhere in be-
tween, so long as the sum of the two ranks does not ex-
ceed your Create rank. –1 cost per rank.

DAZZLE

Effect:  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Limited  to  One
Sense • 2 points per rank

You can overwhelm one of the target’s senses, chosen
when  you  take  this  effect.  The  target  makes  a  Forti-
tude  or  Will  resistance  check  against  your  effect  DC
(choose one when you acquire the effect). One degree
of failure leaves the sense impaired (–2 penalty). Two
degrees leave it disabled (–5 penalty) while three de-
grees  leave  the  sense  unaware: The  target  automati-
cally fails Perception checks involving the sense, and
everything effectively has total concealment from that
sense.

The target makes a new resistance check at the end of
each  turn  to  recover.  Success  removes  the  condition
imposed by the Dazzle power. Failure

Limited  to  One  Type:  Your  Quickness  applies  to  only
physical or mental tasks, not both. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to One Task: Your Quickness applies to only one
particular  task,  such  as  reading,  mathematical  calcula-
tions, and so forth. –2 cost per rank.

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You recover quickly from damage. Remove penalties to
your  Toughness  checks  due  to  damage  equal  to  your
Regeneration rank each minute. You then recover other
damage  conditions  equal  to  your  Regeneration  rank
each minute, starting from your most severe condition.
Spread  this  recovery  out  evenly  over  a  minute  (10  ac-
tion  rounds).  So  with  Regeneration  5,  you  remove  a  –1
Toughness penalty every other round (every round with
Regeneration 10, and up to a –2 penalty per round with
Regeneration 20).

Characters  with  no  Stamina  do  not  heal  (see  Absent
Abilities in the Abilities chapter). One or more ranks of
Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character
with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate; additional
Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.
EXTRAS

Persistent:  You  can  regenerate  even  Incurable  damage
conditions (see the Incurable modifier). +1 cost per rank.
FLAWS

Source: Your Regeneration only works when you have ac-
cess  to  a  particular  source  to  replenish  yourself,  such  as
blood, electricity, sand, scrap metal, sunlight, and so forth.
–1 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Rank
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–5 points per rank

You can displace one or more of your senses over a dis-
tance, perceiving as if you were at that location, up to 60
feet away. Each additional rank increases your range one
distance rank, so rank 2 is 120 feet, rank 3 is 250 feet, and
so  on.  Remote  Sensing  overrides  your  normal  sense(s)
while  you  are  using  it.  Subjects  observed  via  Remote
Sensing can “feel” it with an Insight check (DC 10 + rank).

You can make Perception checks normally using your dis-
placed senses, taking the normal action to do so. To search
a  large  area  for  someone  or  something,  use  the  search

Quickness,  like  many  power  effects,  is  not  especially
realistic;  it  allows  you  to  do  things  like  disassemble
an  entire  car  as  a  free  action  at  a  high  enough  rank
(around  rank  13-14),  but  doesn’t  have  any  effect  on

*These numbers are for the Summoner only; for the Du-
plicator,  use  the  totals  listed  for  the  appropriate Twin  or
Triplets, then add the points for the Summon power.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

•

•

•

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

Supernatural Creatures are fantastical beings out of folk-
tales and scary stories. They’re generally regarded as ur-

Flash-bang  grenade:  A  flash-bang  grenade  gives  off  a

Sleep gas grenade: This grenade releases a gas with an
Affliction (Sleep) effect.

Tear gas grenade: This type of grenade releases a cloud
of  gas  that  irritates  the  eyes  and  lungs,  causing  tempo-
rarily blindness and nausea (an Affliction with dazed and
visually impaired, stunned and visually disabled, and inca-
pacitated effects).

Dynamite: A common explosive. The damage on the ta-
ble is for a single stick of dynamite. Each doubling of the
amount of explosive increases Damage rank by 1.

Plastic explosive: Another common explosive, which can
be worked into different shapes. The damage listed is for
a 1-lb block. Each doubling of the amount of explosive in-
creases Damage rank by 1.

ARMOR

With so many weapons and super-powered attacks around, characters may need armor to protect them. Some heroes
are innately tough enough to stand up to a lot of punishment, while others rely on their high Dodge and Parry ranks.
Others choose to wear armor, ranging from ancient metal armors to modern composites or ultra-modern battlesuits.

Armor provides a Protection effect, a bonus to Toughness. Like other equipment, armor bonuses do not stack with other
armor or effect bonuses, only the highest bonus applies, one of the reasons why tough heroes rarely, if ever, wear armor.

Effect: Damage, Reaction • 4 points per rank

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You can surround your body with an aura of damaging
energy or some similar effect. Anyone you touch or that
touches you must make a Toughness resistance check
against your aura’s Damage rank. You can turn your aura
on and off at will as a free action. If your Aura damages
some targets but not others, apply the Selective or Lim-
ited modifiers (depending on whether or not the selec-
tivity is under your control).

Reduced Trait: One or more of your traits is lowered while
others  are  enhanced. This  flaw  is  worth  as  many  points
as  the  reduction  in  the  affected  trait(s).  So,  for  example,
if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the
value  of  the  lost  Intellect  ranks  as  the  value  of  the  flaw.
As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power
point. Flat –points equal to the lowered trait.

You can generate and project a type of energy, such as
cold, electricity, fire, kinetic force, magnetism, radiation,
or  even  cosmic  energy,  in  a  damaging  blast  (see  the
Blast power).

Energy Control is further defined by the addition of Alter-
nate Effects (see Alternate Effects, page 188), expand-
ing what you can do with your control. For example, Cold
Control  might  let  you  lower  the  surrounding  tempera-
ture (Environment – Cold) or trap targets in ice (Affliction,
see  the  Snare  version).  Magnetic  Control  could  let  you
manipulate metallic objects (Limited Move Object) while
Electrical Control lets you generate an electrical pulse to
overload electronics (Burst Area Nullify Electronics). Add
as many Alternate Effects to your Energy Control as you
can afford, and consider some additional ones as options
for power stunts (see Powers Stunts, page 20).

Action: Standard • Range: Rank
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–2 points per rank

You  can  change  the  environment  in  an  area:  raising  or
lowering  the  temperature,  creating  light,  causing  rain,

venture chapter for details).

Your  Environment  affects  a  30  foot  radius  around  you
at rank 1. Each additional rank moves the radius up one
distance rank, for a reach of approximately 2,000 miles at
rank  20,  sufficient  to  alter  the  environment  of  an  entire
continent!

chapter). They have no Fortitude defense.

they are alive).

Presence: Creatures without Presence are unable to
interact and immune to interaction skills. They have
no Will defense.

Lacking an ability is –10 power points; that is, it gives the
character  an  additional  10  power  points  to  spend  else-
where,  similar  to  having  a  –5  rank  in  an  ability,  but  with
different  effects.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  heroes  cannot  be
absent an ability without Gamemaster permission, as it can
have significant effects on the character and the game.

Fighting: A creature with no Fighting is incapable of
making any sort of close attack (but may still be able
to launch ranged attacks, if it has Dexterity).

Absent abilities cannot be weakened (see the Weaken ef-
fect in the Powers chapter) or debilitated, since they are
not present at all in the first place!

Intellect: A creature with no Intellect is an automa-
ton, lacking free will and operating entirely on simple
instinct  or  pre-programmed  instructions.  Anything
with no Intellect is immune to mental effects and in-
teraction skills and has no Will defense.

Awareness:  Anything  with  no  Awareness  is  com-
pletely unaware and also has no Presence. It is an in-
animate object, not a creature. Objects are immune
to mental effects and interaction skills, and have no

Inanimate  objects  have  no  abilities  other  than  their

bots or zombies have Strength, Agility, and Dexterity, and
may  have  ranks  of  Awareness  and  Presence  (if  aware  of
their environment or capable of interaction), and Fighting
(if able to make close attacks). They may have Intellect (if
capable  of  independent  thought),  but  have  no  Stamina
(since  they  are  not  living  things).  See  Constructs  in  the

PRINCESS

Julia wants to play a fairly straightforward hero: super-strong and tough, but also a beautiful
young woman with an eye for fashion! She draws a sketch of a smiling, slender woman in a

pink T-shirt that says “Princess” on it in silver sequins, holding a car over her head!

Right off, Julia knows Princess is strong, really strong. So she assigns her Strength 12;
higher than PL10, but still not so high that she can’t also have a reasonable close
combat bonus. That Strength is enough for Princess to lift a hundred tons! She

can heft that car with ease! Julia gives her Stamina 12 to match.

Since she sees Princess as graceful, like a gymnast, Julia gives her Agility
5, but she goes with Dexterity 3, since her character isn’t as coordinated
(although she’s still above average). Likewise, Julia assigns Princess 2 ranks
each  in  Intellect,  Awareness,  and  Presence;  she’s  smart,  sassy,  and  deter-
mined, but not amazingly so. Julia wants Princess to be a capable close-up
fighter, so she gives her Fighting 6. That’s a total of 44 ranks in abilities for 88

power points, leaving 62 remaining.

Next up: powers. Julia wants Princess to be fast and tough. She gives her 4 ranks of
Speed, allowing her to keep up with a slow-moving car, and assigns her 5 ranks in Im-
munity (allowing her to ignore cold, disease, heat, pressure, and radiation) along with some
Impervious Toughness (8 ranks) and Regeneration (2 ranks). That’s 19 points in powers,

43 remaining.

Given her great Strength and Agility, Julia also sees Princess as being able to jump re-
ally far, so she gives her 7 ranks in Leaping as well. That’s another 7 points, leaving 36.

Julia looks over the advantage list, taking notes as she goes. She likes the idea of
Princess being a real toughy: having things like Diehard and Ultimate Tough-
ness,  along  with  Interpose  (allowing  her  to  take  the  hit  for  a  teammate).
But she also wants her to be quick and inspirational. She likes Attractive,
Extraordinary  Effort,  Inspire,  and  Well-informed.  That’s  seven  advan-
tages thus far. She rounds out the list with some combat maneuvers
like All-out Attack and Power Attack (since Princess can cut loose if
she needs to), Improved Initiative (she’s quick) and another rank
of Inspire. That’s another four advantages, for a total of 11 points.

Julia  asks  the  Gamemaster  about  one  more  advantage:

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The following archetypes are ready to play for a power level 10 series. Some require a few simple choices or offer options
for customization. Gamemasters can also use these archetypes as ready-made villains, if desired.

The Gadgeteer and Martial Artist rely a great deal on their
advantages (as do other archetypes like the Crime Fighter
and Weapon Master). You’ll want to read the descriptions
of all of the character’s advantages from the Advantages
chapter so you know the benefits they provide. Remem-
ber to make use of them during play to give your charac-
ter every appropriate, well, advantage.

In particular, note how some advantages and even pow-
ers work together. The Gadgeteer can use Quick-Thinking
to speed up the process of inventing (see Inventing, page
211) and Skill Mastery (Technology) to make some invent-
ing  checks  as  routine.  Similarly,  note  the  Martial  Artist’s
Power Attack advantage, good for doing extra damage to
slow, tough, opponents, and the Skill Mastery (Acrobatics)
advantage  for  pulling  off  formidable  (DC  25)  Acrobatics
checks as routine!

The  Mimic  and  Mystic  archetypes  are  both  very  flexible,
although in different ways, and it pays to know what your
character is capable of doing before you are immersed in
the midst of a game.

In the case of the Mimic, the GM may wish to put together
note cards or some other quick reference to the powers of
other characters whom the Mimic might wish to duplicate.
That way, you can see at a glance what traits the character
can copy, and simply hand the card to the player for refer-
ence.  Experienced  Mimics  may  even  build  up  a “hand”  of
such cards they reference often.

For  the  Mystic,  in  addition  to  choosing  your  charac-
ter’s  five  set  Alternate  Effects  (see  Alternate  Effect  on
page  188),  read  the  Magic  sample  power  on  page  168
of the Powers chapter and give some thought to power
stunts your character can do; spur of the moment spells
whipped up to fit a particular need. Mytics are very effec-
tive at power stunts and you might want to reserve a hero
point (or two) for that purpose.

The  Paragon  and  Powerhouse  are  among  the  strongest
archetypes,  able  to  lift  and  carry  a  lot  of  weight.  Just  to
give you an idea, the Paragon can lift a loaded 747 aircraft,
whereas the Powerhouse can lift four times that amount.
Both can easily smash through stone or bend steel.

Both archetypes are pretty tough, to

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Lady  Liberty,  rescuing  people  from  a
tenement  fire,  is  hemmed-in  by  collapsed  debris.
Her player decides to simply punch a path through.
Since  she’s  going  for  maximum  damage,  she  de-
cides  to  make  the  attack  check  normally  (rather
than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she’ll
only miss on a natural 1 anyway. She succeeds and
does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic
critical. The GM decides the brick, mortar, and heavy
beams have a toughness of 9 and makes a Tough-
ness  check,  rolling  a  5,  against  a  DC  30  (Lady  Lib-
erty’s Damage +15). A 14 result is three degrees of
failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and
clears the building, carrying people to safety!

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

Living targets remove one damage condition per minute
of  rest,  starting  from  their  worst  condition  and  working
back. So a damaged character recovers from being inca-
pacitated, then staggered, dazed, and finally removes a –1
Toughness check penalty per minute until fully recovered.
The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications  (see  Lasting Injuries  in  the  Recovery section
of the Action & Adventure chapter).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

CREATE

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while Sum-
mon  conjures  creatures  of  some  sort,  capable  of  inde-
pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS
CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

Heroes sneak into the closely guarded lairs of criminal masterminds, infiltrate alien computer systems, and build devices
beyond the understanding of modern science. They can piece together obscure clues to a villain’s latest plot, run along
tightropes, and pilot vehicles through obstacle courses, all in a day’s work. In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, they do so through
the use of various skills, described in this chapter.

Skills are learned abilities, a combination of training (the skill) and natural talent (an ability rank). Each skill has a rank,
used as a bonus to the die roll when using the skill. To make a skill check, roll:

d20 + skill rank + ability modifier + miscellaneous modifiers

Your rank in a skill, based on the points you have invested
in that skill. If you have ranks in a skill you’re considered
trained  in  that  skill. You  can  use  some  skills  even  if  you
don’t have any ranks in them, known as using a skill un-
trained. Some skills may not be used untrained.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored  a  critical  success.  Determine  the  degree  of  suc-
cess  normally  and  then  increase  it  by  one  degree.  This
can turn a low-level success into something more signifi-
cant, but more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-
fledged success!

Each  skill  has  an  ability  modifier  applied  to  the  skill’s
checks. Each skill’s ability modifier is noted in its descrip-
tion and on the Skills table. If you use a skill untrained, the
ability modifier still applies to the skill check.

Miscellaneous modifiers to skill checks include modifiers
for circumstances, and bonuses from advantages or pow-
ers, among others.

The higher the total, the better the result. You’re usually look-
ing  for  a  total  that  equals  or  exceeds  a  particular  difficulty
class (DC), which may be based on another character’s traits.

Give your hero skill ranks by spending power points: 2 skill
ranks per power point. Skill ranks do not all need to be as-
signed to the same skill. You can split them between differ-
ent  skills.  Characters  can  perform  some  tasks  without  any
training,  using  only  raw  talent  (as  defined  by  their  ability
ranks), but skilled characters are better at such things. Those
with  the  right  combinations  of  skills  and  advantages  can
even hold their own against super-powered opponents.

Skill Cost = 1 power point per
2 skill ranks.

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

You can get a general idea of just how good a particu-
lar character’s skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class  guidelines  given  in  The  Basics  along  with  the
rules  for  routine  checks  (see  Routine  Checks  in  that
chapter).

For  example,  a  +5  total  skill  modifier  means  the  char-
acter can routinely achieve a result of 15 (a tough task).
Safe to say the character is a pro, able to routinely han-
dle tasks that would prove too much for someone less
skilled.  A  character  with  a  +10  skill  modifier  achieve  a
DC 20 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of
expertise, while a +15 modifier can routinely complete
DC  25  (formidable)  tasks.  At  the  high  end,  a  +30  skill
modifier  can  routinely  accomplishing  the  nigh  impos-
sible (DC 40 tasks)!

Certain skills, called interaction skills, are aimed at deal-
ing  with  others  through  social  interaction.  Interaction
skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get
them to cooperate with you in one way or another. Since
interaction skills are intended for dealing with others so-
cially, they have certain requirements.

First,  you  must  be  able  to  interact  with  the  subject(s)  of
the  skill. They  must  be  aware  of  you  and  able  to  under-
stand you. If they can’t hear or understand you for some
reason, you have a –5 circumstance penalty to your skill
check (see Circumstance Modifiers in The Basics).

Interaction  skills  work  best  on  intelligent  subjects,  ones
with  an  Intellect  rank  of  –4  or  better. You  can  use  them
on creatures with Int –5, but again with a –5 circumstance
penalty;  they’re  just  too  dumb  to  get  the  subtleties  of
your  point. You  can’t  use  interaction  skills  at  all  on  sub-
jects lacking one or more mental abilities. (Try convincing
a  rock  to  be  your  friend—or  afraid  of  you—sometime.)

If you don’t find a particular skill on the list, like climbing,
bluffing, or search, remember that each skill in MUTANTS &
covers a lot of ground. So, you’ll find climbing
isn’t its own skill, but is listed as part of Athletics, while
bluffing and search are under Deception and Investiga-
tion, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill
you think is most similar to what you’re looking for.

The  Immunity  effect  (see  the  Powers  chapter)  can  also
render characters immune to interaction skills.

You  can  use  interaction  skills  on  groups  of  subjects

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

HIDING

OPERATING

If you have cover or concealment, make a Stealth check,
opposed by an observer’s Perception check, to hide and
go unnoticed.

If  others  are  aware  of  your  presence,  you  can’t  use
Stealth  to  remain  undetected.  You  can  run  around  a
corner so you are out of sight and then use Stealth, but
others know which way you went. You can’t hide at all if
you have absolutely no cover or concealment, since that
means you are standing out in plain sight. Of course, if
someone isn’t looking directly at you (you’re sneaking up
from behind, for example), then you have concealment
relative to that person.

A  successful  Deception  or  Intimidation  check  can  give
you the momentary distraction needed to make a Stealth
check  while  people  are  aware  of  you. When  others  turn
their attention from you, make a Stealth check if you can
reach  cover  or  concealment  of  some  kind.  (As  a  general
guideline, any such cover has to be within 1 foot for every
rank you have in Stealth.) This check, however, is at a –5
penalty because you have to move quickly.
TAILING

You  can  use  Stealth  to  tail  someone  at  your  normal
speed.  This  assumes  you  have  some  cover  or  conceal-
ment (crowds of people, shadows, fog, etc.). If the subject
is worried about being followed, he can make a Percep-
tion  check  (opposed  by  your  Stealth  check)  every  time
he  changes  course  (goes  around  a  street  corner,  exits  a
building,  and  so  on).  If  he  is  unsuspecting,  he  only  gets
one Perception check for the scene. If the subject notices
you, make a Deception check, opposed by Insight. If you
succeed, you manage to pass off your presence as coinci-
dence and can continue tailing. A failed Deception check,
or being noticed a second time, means the subject knows
something is up and reacts accordingly.

Most  routine  operations  of  technological  equipment
don’t require a skill check and can be done untrained. Us-
ing an unfamiliar device does require a check, with the DC
determined by how foreign or unusual the device is, from
simple (DC 10) to highly advanced (DC 25 or more).
BUILDING

The difficulty and time required to make an item depends
on its complexity, as shown on the Building Items table. If
your Technology check succeeds, you have made the item
after the necessary time. If the check fails, you did not pro-
duce a usable end result, and any time and materials are

You  can  diagnose  injuries  and  ailments  with  an  eye  to-
ward  further  treatment.  This  takes  at  least  a  minute.  At
the GM’s discretion, a successful diagnosis provides a +2
bonus  for  favorable  circumstances  on  further Treatment
checks.

Providing  care  means  treating  an  injured  patient  for  a
day or more. If successful, the patient further reduces the
recovery  time  by  1  rank  (see  Recovery  in  the  Action  &
Adventure chapter). You can provide care for up to your
Treatment rank in patients at one time.
REVIVE

You  can  remove  the  dazed  or  stunned  conditions  from
a  subject  (see  Conditions  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). The check to revive is a standard action. A suc-
cessful  check  removes  the  condition.  Other  conditions
the patient may have remain, so reviving someone inca-
pacitated due to fatigue still leaves the patient exhaust-
ed, for example, while awakening someone incapacitat-
ed due to damage still leaves the patient staggered. You

As a standard action, a successful Treatment check stabi-
lizes a dying character.

You can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison.
Each time the character makes a resistance check against
the ailment, you make a Treatment check. One degree of
success provides the patient with a +2 circumstance bo-
nus to the resistance check, three or more degrees of suc-
cess provides a +5 circumstance bonus.

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

DISGUISE

You can use makeup, costumes, and other props to change
your appearance. Your Deception check result determines
the effectiveness of the disguise, opposed by others’ Per-
ception check results. The GM makes the Deception check
secretly so you are not sure exactly how well your disguise
holds up under scrutiny.

Disguise  is  heavily  dependent  on  circumstances:  favor-
able ones include appropriate costuming and a subject
resembling your normal appearance, while unfavorable
circumstances include disguising yourself as a member
of a different race or sex, or not having sufficient props
(which can be up to a –5 modifier). If you are imperson-
ating  a  particular  individual,  anyone  who  knows  that
individual gets a circumstance bonus to the Perception
check: regular associates get a +2, while friends get a +5
and intimate loved ones a +10.

Successfully  acting  like  who  you  appear  to  be  may  also
require a Deception check with a DC equal to the observ-
er’s Insight check, modified by familiarity if the observer
knows the subject well, as mentioned previously.

A disguise normally requires at least 10 minutes of prepa-
ration.  The  GM  makes  Perception  checks  for  those  who
encounter you immediately upon meeting you and each
hour or day thereafter, depending on circumstances.

FEINTING

You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an
opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a stan-
dard action opposed by the better of your target’s Decep-
tion or Insight. If your Deception check succeeds, the tar-
get is vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of
your next round (see Vulnerable in the Conditions sec-
tion of The Basics chapter).
INNUENDO

You  can  use  Deception  to  send  covert  messages  using
word-play and double-meanings while apparently talking
about other things. The DC for a basic message is 10. Com-
plex messages or messages trying to communicate new
information have DCs of 15 or 20, respectively. The recipi-
ent of the message must make a Insight check against the
same DC to understand it.

TRANSFORM

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2-5 points per rank

You can change objects into other objects, altering their
shape  or  material  composition  in  the  process. You  must
touch  the  chosen  object,  which  requires  a  close  attack
check if the object is held or worn by another character.

What you can transform affects cost per rank:

•

2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one
other thing or substance, such as metal into wood,
iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.

Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands
of a cunning player. To a degree, Transform can dupli-
cate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by
transforming air into a solid material or turning oxygen
into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). This is perfectly
allowable; use the rules for other effects as guidelines
on how to handle these situations, using Transform rank
to determine resistance DCs.

Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained
duration, which may affect how such “tricks” work (e.g.,
the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffo-
cating gas dissipates unless the character concentrates
each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always,
the GM should use common sense and good judgment.

You  may  wish  to  require  characters  using  Transform
to  acquire  money  (gold,  precious  gems,  etc.)  or  other
permanent  material  goods  to  spend  power  points  on
ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain imperma-
nent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter
in your series in some way.)

It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects:
turning a steel door into water, air, or even rust certain-
ly  removes  it  as  a  barrier.  However,  keep  in  mind  that
Transform  is  normally  sustained;  the  target  isn’t  truly
destroyed unless the effect is continuous, and therefore
irreversible. Even then, the destruction of targets tends
to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of wearing-
down  and  eventually  destroying  objects,  use  Weaken
Toughness instead.

Transforming living or otherwise animate beings as op-
posed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than
Transform. To alter a target’s outward appearance only,
go  with  a  Morph  Attack  (see  the  Morph  effect).  For  a
harmful effect that does something like turn the target

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CREATE

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

Generally, Create makes inanimate objects, while Sum-
mon  conjures  creatures  of  some  sort,  capable  of  inde-
pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless
creatures  like  ro

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

Now the remaining smugglers get to go. They draw their guns and shoot at you!

The GM rolls attack checks against the heroes. Two smugglers shoot at Ultramarine and three shoot at Princess, but they both
have Impervious Toughness 8. Since the smugglers’ guns can’t hurt them, the GM does not bother rolling the attack checks. The
remaining two shoot at Rook, but one is impaired and the other blind, so they both miss by a mile.

Rook, you easily avoid the clumsy shots, especially from the guys dazzled by the flash bomb. Princess, Ultramarine, a
couple of stray shots ricochet off of you harmlessly.
ROUND 2

That brings us back to the top of the order. Princess?

Princess: I’m going to punch-out one of the smugglers! “Hey, watch the couture, boys!”

GM: Roll an unarmed attack check.

Princess: Rolls, gets a natural 20. A critical hit!

GM: Glances at Princess’ Strength of 12, and the +5 critical hit DC modifier, making the Toughness resistance DC (15 + 12 + 5)
or 32. No way the smuggler can succeed.

Wow! You send the guy flying right off the deck and into the drink! Sploosh!

Then, suddenly…

The GM rolls an attack check against Princess, getting a 15 result. Normally this would miss her Dodge defense of 18, but this is
a surprise attack, so Princess is vulnerable and her Dodge is halved to 4, rather than 8, making the DC a 14.

…a steel mesh net launches out of the doorway of the control cabin of the ship. Princess, give me a Dodge resistance
check.

Princess: Rolls a 5 for a total of 13. Um… 13?

GM: Compares it against the DC of 19. Two degrees of failure.

…the net wraps around you tightly, leaving you immobilized and defenseless, Princess.

From out of the control cabin lumbers a massive armored figure in red and silver, one arm ending in a lobster-like servo-
claw.

Ultramarine: Trawler!

GM: In Trawler’s voice. Who did you think was running this operation, heroes? Now back off!

Ultramarine: Is it my turn?

GM: No. It would be, but you delayed until after Rook, remember? Rook, it’s your turn, then Ultramarine and the smug-
glers.

Rook: I don’t think my weapons will do much against Trawler’s armor. Can I help Princess get free from the net?

GM: Your throwing talons might help cut through it.

Rook: Okay, I’ll do that.

GM: Since the net is immobile, do you want to roll or make a routine check?

Rook: If I roll, I get a damage bonus, right? The GM nods. Okay, I’l

sponse to a particular danger, after a set amount of time,
in  response  to  a  particular  event,  and  so  forth—chosen
when  you  apply  the  modifier.  Once  chosen,  the  trigger
cannot be changed.

The  circumstances  must  be  detectable  by  your  senses.
You can acquire Senses Limited and Linked to Triggered
effects, if desired. Setting the effect requires the same ac-
tion as using it normally.

A Triggered  effect  lying  in  wait  may  be  detected  with  a
Perception check (DC 10 + effect rank) and in some cases
disarmed with a successful skill or power check (such as
Sleight  of  Hand, Technology,  Nullify  or  another  counter-
ing effect) with a DC of (10 + effect rank).

A  Triggered  effect  is  good  for  one  use  per  rank  in  this
modifier. After its last activation, it stops working.

You  can  apply  an  additional  rank  of Triggered  to  have  a
Variable Trigger, allowing you to change the effect’s trig-
ger each time you set it.

FLAT • 1-2 POINTS

You can change the descriptors of an effect with this modi-
fier, varying them as a free action once per round. With rank
1, you can apply any of a closely related group of descrip-
tors,  such  as  weather,  electromagnetic,  temperature,  and
so forth. With rank 2, you can apply any of a broad group,
such  as  any  mental,  magical,  or  technological  descriptor.
The GM decides if a given descriptor is appropriate in con-
junction with a particular effect and this modifier.

FLAWS

The  following  section  lists  available  flaws,  starting  with
the flaw’s name and the amount it reduces effect cost (in
power points per rank or flat value), along with a descrip-
tion of how the flaw modifies effects in game terms.

A flat-value flaw cannot have more ranks than the effect
itself.

FLAT • -1 OR -2 POINTS

A  power  with  this  flaw  requires  an  action  to  prepare  or
activate before any of its effects are usable. If the power
requires a move action to activate, the flaw is –1 point. If
it requires a standard action, it is –2 points. Activation tak-
ing  less  than  a  move  action  is  not  a  flaw,  although  may
qualify as a complication (see the Power Loss complica-
tion for details).

Activation has no effect other than making all of the pow-
er’s  effects  available  for  use. The  effects  themselves  still
require their normal actions to use. You can use a power’s
effects in the same turn as you activate it, provided y

LUCK

FORTUNE, RANKED (1/2 PL)

Once per round, you can choose to re-roll a die roll, like
spending a hero point (see Hero Points, page 20), includ-
ing adding 10 to re-rolls of 10 or less. You can do this a
number  of  times  per  game  session  equal  to  your  Luck
rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level
(rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero
points “reset”  at  the  start  of  an  adventure. The  GM  may
choose to set a different limit on ranks in this advantage,
depending on the series.

Generally speaking, languages are not terribly important
in comic book superhero stories except as background col-
or or occasional plot complications. Gamemasters should
allow  players  with  characters  fluent  in  other  languages
the occasional opportunity to show them off or put them
to good use. If you specifically set up the language barrier
as an obstacle by confronting the heroes with a language
they cannot possibly understand, that should count as a
complication and be worth a hero point.

COMBAT

MINION

GENERAL, RANKED

You can draw a weapon from a holster or sheath as a free
action, rather than a move action.

You have a follower or minion. This minion is an indepen-
dent  character  with  a  power  point  total  of  (advantage
rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level
limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions
(if capable of independent thought) automatically have a
helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the nor-
mal rules for minions (see page 245).

Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend
earned  power  points  to  increase  your  rank  in  this  advan-
tage to improve the minion’s power point total and traits.
Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are
replaced in between adventures with other followers with
similar abilities at the Gamemaster’s discretion.

ACTION

COMBAT

When taking a standard action and a move action you can
move both before and after your standard action, provid-
ed the total distance moved isn’t greater than your normal
movement speed.

COMBAT

When  you  make  a  power  attack  (see  Maneuvers,  page
250)  you  can  take  a  penalty  of  up  to  –5  on  your  attack
bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to the effect
bonus of your attack.
