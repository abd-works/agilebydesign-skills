CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

ample,  Enhanced  Strength  5  increases  your  Strength  by
+5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to
power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be be-
low the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement
to accommodate it.

You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your
reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to de-
termine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized hu-
man (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2,
and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles!
“Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action.

The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquir-
ing a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that
Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait,
and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and
other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and
Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a great-
er  distance  by  elongating  your  limbs.  Once  elongated,
you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a
standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target
(you’re  elongating  around  a  corner,  for  example),  apply
the  rules  for  concealment  (see  Concealment  in  the  Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows
you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a
+1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

into  play—like  losing  your  Enhanced  Trait  during  a  new
moon—can be handled as a power loss complication. See
Complications in The Basics chapter for details. –1 cost per

Permanent:  At  no  change  in  cost,  your  Enhanced  Trait

•

Identity:  The  Paragon  often  hides  his  or  her  true
identity  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Often  the  Para-
gon feels that this “normal” identity keeps him or her
grounded and in touch with the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: The Paragon is motivat-
ed to be a hero because it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  The  Paragon  is  a  patriot
and fights to uphold the ideals of his or her country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Paragon  is  often
motivated  by  the  belief  that  with  power  comes  re-
sponsibility.

•

•

•

Power  Loss:  Usually  caused  by  transforming  back
to a normal human form, some Paragons lack access
to  their  powers  all  the  time.  If  you  choose  this  op-
tion, create a non-powered version of your character
that doesn’t have any of its Powers, has human-level
Abilities, and may even have lower ranks of Skills and
completely different Advantages.

Prejudice:  Some  Paragons  are  appear  inhuman  in
some way and are treated with distrust or fear by the
public.

Relationship:  Paragons  often  have  a  large  number
of  friends,  family,  or  fans  that  get  into  trouble  with
alarming frequency.

•  Weakness: Because the Paragon is so powerful in so
many ways, he or she often suffers from a crippling
weakness to a particular type of attack.

The Powerhouse is the strongest one there is! Where other
archetypes spread their points out amongst a number of
different  powers  and  abilities,  the  Powerhouse  concen-
trates  on  two  things:  strength  and  protection.  In  fights,
the Powerhouse is always on the front line, tearing it up
and,  even  so,  is  usually  the  last  one  standing. The  Pow-
erhouse  is  often  inhuman-looking,  either  because  he  or
she’s been turned into a hulking brute, or is from an alien
world, or is capable of transforming into living stone, steel,
or something equally resistant to damage.

fense over the base rank provided by your hero’s abilities.
To improve your hero’s Toughness, see Advantages and

Choose  the  skill  ranks  you  want  your  character  to  have
and pay 1 power point per 2 total skill ranks. See the Skills

6. ADVANTAGES

Choose the advantages you want your character to have
and pay 1 power point per advantage or rank in a advan-

7. POWERS

Create  your  hero’s  powers  by  choosing  their  desired  ef-
fects  and  paying  the  effects’  base  cost,  adjusted  for  any
modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks. See the
Powers chapter for details.
8. COMPLICATIONS

Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can
have more, if you want, and the more complications your
hero  faces,  the  greater  your  chances  for  earning  hero

points during the game. See the Complications section
of this chapter for details.
9. DETAILS

Go  through  the  limits  listed  under  Power  Level  in  this
chapter and make sure your hero’s traits all fit within them.
If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.

Go back through and add up the costs of your hero’s abili-
ties, defenses, skills, advantages, and powers. You should
end  up  with  a  figure  equal  to  the  starting  power  points
shown on the Starting Power Points table. If not, double-
check your math and either remove or add traits to your
character to reach the starting power point total.

Figure out things like your hero’s name, appearance, origin,
background, and motivation. If you can, consider creating a
sketch or detailed description of your hero’s costume.

10. GAMEMASTER APPROVAL

Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The
GM should check again to make sure your power points
are  spent  and  added  up  correctly,  your  hero  follows  the
power  level  guidelines  and  any  other  guidelines  set  for
the  series,  and  that  the  character  is  generally  complete
and  suited  to  the  overall  game.  Once  your  GM  has  ap-
proved, your new hero is ready for play!

You design a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero by spending pow-
er points on different traits. Each ability, skill, advantage,
power, and other trait has an associated power point cost.

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

type  can  be  used  as  anything  from  an  archaeologist  to

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

107

Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.

STRENGTH (STR)

INTELLECT (INT)

Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to
apply it. Your Strength rank applies to:

•

Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based
attacks.
How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).
The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.
Athletics skill checks.

•
•
•
STAMINA (STA)

Stamina  is  health,  endurance,  and  overall  physical  resil-
ience.  Stamina  is  important  because  it  affects  a  charac-
ter’s ability to resist most forms of damage. Your Stamina
modifier applies to:

•
•

•

Toughness defense, for resisting damage.
Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your
character’s health.
Stamina  checks  to  resist  or  recover  from  things  af-
fecting  your  character’s  health  when  a  specific  de-
fense doesn’t apply.

AGILITY (AGL)

Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coor-
dination. Your Agility rank applies to:

•

•
•
•

Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and oth-
er hazards.
Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.
Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.
Agility  checks  for  feats  of  coordination,  gross  move-
ment, and quickness when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

DEXTERITY (DEX)

Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  hand-eye  coordination,  preci-
sion, and manual dexterity. Your Dexterity rank applies to:

•
•
•

Attack checks for ranged attacks.
Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.
Dexterity  checks  for  feats  of  fine  control  and  preci-
sion when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

FIGHTING (FGT)

Fighting  measures  your  character’s  ability  in  close  com-
bat, from hitting a target to ducking and weaving around
any counter-attacks. Your Fighting rank applies to:

•
•

Attack checks for close attacks.
Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.

Intellect covers reasoning ability and learning. A character
with a high Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and
well-educated. Your Intellect modifier applies to:

•

•

Expertise,  Investigation, Technology,  and Treatment
skill checks.
Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-
power when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

AWARENESS (AWE)

While  Intellect  covers  reasoning,  Awareness  describes
common sense and intuition, what some might call “wis-
dom.” A character with a high Intellect and a low Aware-
ness may be an “absent-minded professor” type, smart

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

provides a framework for your imagination. It has rules to help determine what happens in your
stories and to resolve conflicts between characters and the challenges they face. With it, you can experience adventure
as a hero fighting against the forces of evil! Any adventure you can imagine is possible.

Like all games, MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS has rules. This chapter looks at the basic rules of the game and how they work,
giving you the foundation upon which the rest of the game is built.

uses a standard, or “core,” game me-
chanic to resolve actions. Whenever a character attempts
an action with a chance of failure, do the following:

•

•

•

Roll a twenty-sided die (or d20).

Add any relevant modifiers (for game traits like abili-
ties, skills, powers, or circumstances) to the number
rolled.

Compare  the  total  to  a  number  called  a  difficulty
class (abbreviated DC).

If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class (set by the
GM  based  on  the  circumstances),  the  effort  succeeds.  If
the result is lower than the difficulty class, it fails.

This simple mechanic is used for nearly everything in MU-
MASTERMINDS, with variations based on what modi-
fiers are made to the roll, what determines the difficulty
class, and the exact degree of success and failure. Remem-
ber...

d20 + modifiers vs. difficulty class

... and you understand how to play most of the game!

One of the players in a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game takes
the  role  of  Gamemaster  (abbreviated  GM).  The  Game-
master is responsible for running the game—a combina-
tion  of  writer,  director,  and  referee.  The  GM  creates  the
adventures for the heroes, portrays the villains and sup-
porting characters, describes the world to the players, and
decides the outcome of the heroes’ actions based on the
roll of the die and the guidelines given in the rules. It’s a
big  job,  but  also  a  rewarding  one,  since  the  Gamemas-
ter gets to develop the world and all the characters in it,
along with inventing fun and exciting stories.

If  you’re  going  to  be  the  Gamemaster,  you  should  read
through this whole book carefully. You should have a firm
grasp of the rules, since you’re expected to interpret them
for the players to help decide what happens in the game.
You’ll  also  help  the  players  develop  their  own  heroes,
making sure they fit into the world and have potential for
exciting stories in their own right.

Identity:  Some  Powerhouses  keep  their  identity  a
secret  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Especially  those
Powerhouses  that  can  change  into  and  out  of  their
super-powered identity.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Those  Powerhouses  with
the  Prejudice  complication  often  choose  this  mo-
tivation  and  become  a  hero  in  order  to  earn  a  place
in  “normal”  society.  An  alien  Powerhouse  may  also
choose this motivation even if he or she doesn’t look
unusual.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  Many  Powerhouses  are

their country.

powers, many Powerhouses become heroes because
they feel as if they have a responsibility to do so.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

185

Powers  based  off  the Variable  effect  are  obviously  very  flexible,  capable  of  duplicating  a  wide  range  of  other  effects.
Responsibility for controlling Variable effects in the game is placed largely in the hands of both the Gamemaster and
responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with numerous game-system limitations
that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of effects.

Keep in mind a Variable effect is not supposed to be “any effect I want.” That kind of unlimited power doesn’t belong in the
hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A Variable effect can be “any effect within a
given set of parameters,” but it’s up to you and the GM to define those parameters. The limits of power flexibility in MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS are deliberately set by Variable effects, the use of extra effort, and hero points.

Many  comic  book  heroes  who  appear  to  have  the  power  to “do  anything”  are  actually  using  one  of  these  options  in
terms.  For  example,  a  super-wizard  can  do  practically  anything  with  magic.  However,  generally
speaking, these characters have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with power points) and
“stunts” they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly hero points).
This is why the Magic power given later in this chapter, for example, is not a Variable effect: most powers in the game
have the potential to do “stunts” via extra effort, so the “variability” of Magic seen in the comics is already built-in to the
system, with some costs to control it, without having to give players carte blanche to duplicate any effect in the game at
will (which is just likely to slow things down and cause game balance issues).

Variable effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and define everything about a given power in
advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an application of the Morph effect with a long
list of Metamorph options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at a time, would be tedious to say the
least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A Variable effect, with the descriptor “animal
forms” is easier to manage. The player can pre-build certain commonly used animal forms for use during play, but also ha

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

You can use combinations of advantages—particularly combat advantages—to create different “fighting styles” rang-
ing from martial arts to superhero combat techniques. For example, a “soft” fighting style focusing primarily on defense
might include the advantages Defensive Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Trip, and Instant Up. A “hard” fighting style
focused on offense might include All-out Attack, Improved Critical, Improved Smash, Power Attack, and Startle for a fierce
kiai shout! You can combine various advantages to create specific styles or allow players to mix-and-match to design their
own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet
mastered a style may have only some of a style’s associated advantages rather than all of them.

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

•

•

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

Kung Fu: Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Improved Smash, Improved Trip, Instant Up, Power Attack,
Startle.

Sword-fighting: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Taunt.

•  Wrestling: Chokehold, Fast Grab, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Power Attack.

Comic book martial artists often have abilities far beyond the scope of the advantages and fighting styles given in this
chapter. Such superhuman martial arts abilities as leaping vast distances, punching through solid stone, shrugging off
damage, and killing with a mere touch are powers. See the Powers chapter for details.

bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to both your
active defenses (Dodge and Parry).

COMBAT, RANKED

You can avoid damage through agility and “rolling” with
an  attack. You  receive  a  bonus  to  your Toughness  equal
to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active de-
fense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in
the  Abilities  chapter),  so  you  lose  this  bonus  whenever
you  are  vulnerable  or  defenseless. Your  total Toughness,
including this advantage, is still limited by power level.

This advantage is common for heroes who lack either su-
perhuman speed or toughness, rely

•  Motivation—Recognition: Shapeshifters sometimes
become heroes in order to receive praise or fame.

•  Motivation—Thrills: Many Shapeshifters become he-

their powers often keep them from any lasting injury.

friends and family around them.

SPEEDSTER

Speedsters can move great distances in little or no time.
They  do  this  either  by  running  or  flying  at  superhuman
speeds, or by instantly transporting themselves from one
place to another. Because of their great speed, Speedsters
seldom need ranged powers. Speedsters are also able to
use their movement mode to break the laws of physics in
ways even other fast superheroes are incapable of doing.

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through
the ranks and now run the show. Physically a crime lord
is  no  match  for  a  hero,  but  their  connections,  resources,
and  knowledge  of  the  underworld  can  be  problematic.

crime lord’s power and influence for the series.

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

The  exception  is  Toughness,  which  can  only  be  increased
above your base Stamina rank using advantages and pow-
ers, not by direct spending of power points. This reflects that
greater-than-normal Toughness is virtually always some sort
of special ability. See the Advantages and Powers chapters
for various options for improving Toughness, notably the De-
fensive Roll advantage and the Protection effect.

Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to
be fully effective. Limits on your mobility, focus, and reac-
tion time adversely affect them. If you are vulnerable, your
Dodge  and  Parry  defense  ranks  are  halved  (divide  their
normal values by 2 and round up), and if you are defense-
less, they are both reduced to 0!

One  use  of  defenses  is  determining  a  defense  class,  or
the  difficulty  class  to  affect  a  target  with  a  particular  at-
tack. This  is  the  appropriate  defense,  plus  10,  just  like  a
routine  check  (indeed,  it  is  essentially  a  measure  of  the
character’s “routine” defense). So hitting a character with
a ranged attack goes against Dodge defense, giving the
attack a DC of (Dodge + 10). Similarly, affecting someone
with a mental power goes against Will defense, with a DC
of (Will + 10), and so forth. This is referred to as “targeting”
a defense, such as “targets Dodge” or “targets Will”.

The main defense class traits are Dodge, Parry, and Will.

Defenses  are  also  used  to  measure  the  ability  to  over-
come certain effects, involving a resistance check of the
defense plus a die roll against a difficulty class determined
by the effect or hazard. So you might make a Fortitude re-
sistance check for your hero to overcome a toxin, for ex-
ample, or a Dodge resistance check to avoid a trap just as
it is triggered, and so on. This is referred to as “resisting,”
such as “resisted by Fortitude” or “resisted by Dodge”.

The  main  resistance  check  traits  are  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, and Will.

When  things  start  happening  quickly,  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
characters use their initiative bonuses to determine
who goes first. Each character involved in a conflict makes
a check of d20 + initiative modifier, which is:

Initiative Modifier = Agility + Advantages
(Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers

Characters then act in initiative order, from highest to low-
est. For details see the Action & Adventure chapter.

MYSTIC

The  Mystic  commands  vast  magical  powers  and  uses
them  to  defend  the  Earth  from  otherworldly  threats  as
well  as  to  combat  the  evils  found  just  down  the  street.
The  Mystic  typically  has  extensive  knowledge  of  magic
and other realms, but few real-world skills to speak of. The
magical powers the Mystic commands are nearly limitless,
allowing  the  Mystic  to  fire  blasts  of  magical  energy,  fly,
create  illusions,  heal  others,  travel  to  other  dimensions,
and reproduce virtually any other power imaginable.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES
CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

Everyone has certain basic abilities: how strong, fast, smart, and clever they are. These abilities influence most things
your character does. Stronger characters can lift greater weights, more agile characters have better balance, tougher
characters can soak up more damage, and so forth.

characters have eight basic abilities: Strength (Str), Stamina (Sta), Dexterity (Dex), Agility (Agl),
Fighting (Ftg), Intellect (Int), Awareness (Awe), and Presence (Pre). Strength, Dexterity, Agility and Stamina are physical
abilities, whereas Fighting, Intellect, Awareness, and Presence are mental abilities. Each above-average ability pro-
vides a bonus on certain die rolls; while below average abilities apply a penalty.

Each ability has a rank associated with it, based on how above or below average it is. Abilities start at rank 0, the baseline
average for an adult human being. They can go as low as –5 (truly terrible) and as high as 20, with higher values reserved
for truly cosmic beings and forces.

The ability rank is added to, or subtracted from, die rolls when your character does something related to that ability. For
example, your Strength rank affects the amount of damage you do when punching someone. Your Intellect rank comes
into play when you roll skills based on Intellect, and so forth. Sometimes your rank is used to calculate another value, such
as when you use your Agility to determine how good you are at avoiding harm with your reflexes (your Dodge defense).

You  choose  your  hero’s  ability  ranks  by  spending  power
points  on  them.  Increasing  an  ability  rank  by  1  costs  2
power points, so putting two points into Strength, for ex-
ample, raises it from 0 to 1. Remember a rank of 0 is av-
erage,  2  is  a  fair  amount  of  talent  or  natural  ability,  3  is
exceptional, 4 extraordinary, and so forth. (See the Ability
Benchmarks table for guidelines.)

You can also lower one or more of your character’s ability
ranks from the starting value of 0. Each rank you lower an
ability gives you an additional two power points to spend
elsewhere.  You  cannot  lower  an  ability  rank  below  –5,
which is itself a serious deficiency.

Ability Cost = 2 power points
per +1 to an ability rank.

Gain 2 bonus power points
per -1 to an ability rank.

not even on your turn. Reactions don’t count against your
normal  allotment  of  actions  and  you  can  react  as  often
as the circumstances dictate, but only when they dictate.

Heroes  run  into  their  share  of  difficulties  in  their  work.
One way MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS measures this is with dif-
ferent  conditions.  They  are  shorthand  for  the  different
game modifiers imposed by things from power effects to
injuries or fatigue. So, for example, “vulnerable” is a condi-
tion where a hero’s active defenses are reduced. An oppo-
nent grabbing them or an entangling mass of glue might
make heroes vulnerable, or they might be made vulner-
able by a foe’s cunning combat maneuver or being caught
off-guard. The game effect is the same (the hero’s active
defenses  are  reduced),  so  it  is  easier  to  just  refer  to  the
overall condition as “vulnerable” and describe the differ-
ent situations that cause it.

This section describes the different conditions that can af-
fect characters in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS. If multiple condi-
tions apply, use all of their effects. Some conditions super-
sede other, lesser, conditions, as given in their descriptions.

Each  basic  condition  describes  a  single  game  modifier.
They are the “building blocks” of conditions, much as ef-
fects  are  the  basic  building  blocks  of  powers.  Indeed,
many  power  effects  reference  these  basic  conditions  in

the descriptions of what they do. See the Powers chapter
for details.

Compelled: A compelled character is directed by an
outside force, but struggling against it; the character
is limited to free actions and a single standard action
per turn, with both types of action being chosen by
another, controlling character. As usual, this standard
action  can  be  traded  for  a  move  action.  Controlled
supersedes compelled.

Controlled:  A  controlled  character  has  no  free  will;
the character’s actions each turn are dictated by an-
other, controlling, character.

Dazed:  A  dazed  character  is  limited  to  free  actions
and a single standard action per turn, although the
character may use that action to perform a move, as
usual. Stunned supersedes dazed.

Debilitated: The character has one or more abilities
lowered below –5. (See Debilitated Abilities in the
Abilities chapter.)

Defenseless: A defenseless character has active de-
fense  bonuses  of  0.  Attackers  can  make  a

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-
sessed Construct may recall enough of its former life
to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Construct may feel
that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

•

•

Enemy:  The  Construct  could  be  a  rogue  android,
golem,  or  summoned  elemental  hunted  by  its

the Construct is evil for some reason.

of control, or awaken sleeping horrors, or cause other
unintended consequences that have to be dealt with.

Enemy: Some Mystics are plagued by enemies who
want to displace them or steal their power.

Honor:  It’s  not  uncommon  for  a  Mystic  to  follow  a
code of conduct that keeps them on the straight and
narrow,  perhaps  because  it’s  the  right  thing  to  do,
perhaps because they need to in order to keep their
powers in check.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Mystics  are  often  either
not from Earth or were trained in the mystic arts on
another  world. When  they  come  to  this  plane  they
use their talents to help others and hopefully earn a
place for themselves on their adopted world.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Mystic was given
his  or  her  power  for  a  reason—to  defend  Earth,  to
hunt down otherworldly creatures, or any number of
other options. Or perhaps the Mystic recognizes that
his or her power comes with a price.

•

•

Power  Loss:  Mystics  often  have  the  Complication
that  prevents  them  from  using  their  powers  when
they can’t move and/or speak to cast their spells.

Prejudice: Some Mystics are surrounded by an aura
of “otherness”  that  sets  them  apart  from  the  rest  of
humanity and makes it difficult for them to interact
with others. Or, maybe people just fear witches.

PARAGON

Paragons are what people first think of when they think
of superheroes. A Paragon is nearly perfect in every way:
fast, strong, tough, often has the ability to fly, and repre-
sents everything good about humanity. Paragons are of-
ten talented in a wide range of areas and easily take on
leadership roles.

FLAWS

Limited  to  One  Type:  Your  Quickness  applies  to  only
physical or mental tasks, not both. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to One Task: Your Quickness applies to only one
particular  task,  such  as  reading,  mathematical  calcula-
tions, and so forth. –2 cost per rank.

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You recover quickly from damage. Remove penalties to
your  Toughness  checks  due  to  damage  equal  to  your
Regeneration rank each minute. You then recover other
damage  conditions  equal  to  your  Regeneration  rank
each minute, starting from your most severe condition.
Spread  this  recovery  out  evenly  over  a  minute  (10  ac-
tion  rounds).  So  with  Regeneration  5,  you  remove  a  –1
Toughness penalty every other round (every round with
Regeneration 10, and up to a –2 penalty per round with
Regeneration 20).

Characters  with  no  Stamina  do  not  heal  (see  Absent
Abilities in the Abilities chapter). One or more ranks of
Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character
with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate; additional
Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.
EXTRAS

Persistent:  You  can  regenerate  even  Incurable  damage
conditions (see the Incurable modifier). +1 cost per rank.
FLAWS

Source: Your Regeneration only works when you have ac-
cess  to  a  particular  source  to  replenish  yourself,  such  as
blood, electricity, sand, scrap metal, sunlight, and so forth.
–1 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Rank
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–5 points per rank

You can displace one or more of your senses over a dis-
tance, perceiving as if you were at that location, up to 60
feet away. Each additional rank increases your range one
distance rank, so rank 2 is 120 feet, rank 3 is 250 feet, and
so  on.  Remote  Sensing  overrides  your  normal  sense(s)
while  you  are  using  it.  Subjects  observed  via  Remote
Sensing can “feel” it with an Insight check (DC 10 + rank).

You can make Perception checks normally using your dis-
placed senses, taking the normal action to do so. To search
a  large  area  for  someone  or  something,  use  the  search

Quickness,  like  many  power  effects,  is  not  especially
realistic;  it  allows  you  to  do  things  like  disassemble
an  entire  car  as  a  free  action  at  a  high  enough  rank
(around  rank  13-14),  but  doesn’t  have  any  effect  on

mankind, he or she may also become a hero for the
same reason.

•  Motivation—Recognition:  Some  Gadgeteers  want
their genius recognized not just by other  scientists,
but by millions of adoring fans.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Gadgeteer  often
feels it’s only right to use his or her incredible intel-
ligence to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Gadgeteers  love  to  push  the
limit and live on the edge of scientific research, so it
only makes sense that they might like dressing up in
tights and taking on the role of a hero.

•

•

Quirk—Psychological Problems: Perhaps the Gad-
geteer’s  devices  have  slowly  been  poisoning  his
or  her  mind,  or  biofeedback  caused  by  improperly
functioning cybernetics or other mechanical systems
have  caused  the  Gadgeteer  to  exhibit  some  sort  of
mental problem.

Relationship:  Gadgeteers  often  have  a  number  of
important  people  in  their  life,  either  family,  loved
ones, other researchers, or employees who like to get
into trouble.

The Martial Artist has honed his skills in unarmed combat
to  bridge  the  physical  gap  between  him  and  his  super-
powered  associates.  In  fact,  some  Martial  Artists  display
feats  that  seem  impossible  by  normal  standards—and
may have a mystical origin.

plicator,  use  the  totals  listed  for  the  appropriate Twin  or
Triplets, then add the points for the Summon power.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

Supernatural Creatures are fantastical beings out of folk-

Chapter 5 and see if any of the powers there inspire a char-
acter idea. You may want to jot down a few notes about the
sort of hero you’d prefer to play, which will help guide you
through the rest of the character design process.

2. GAMEMASTER GUIDELINES

Your GM may have particular guidelines for characters in
the game, such as not allowing certain powers or concepts
or  requiring  particular  descriptors.  If  there  are  no  aliens

in the setting, for example, then you obviously can’t play
an alien hero. Likewise, if your Gamemaster bans mental
powers  from  the  series,  then  a  psychic  isn’t  appropriate.
Run  your  hero  concept  by  your  Gamemaster  before  you
start working on it! You might also want to consult with
your fellow players so you can design your characters to-
gether and ensure they’ll make a good team.
3. POWER LEVEL

Your GM sets the starting power level for the series. Gener-
ally, this is level 10, but it may range anywhere from level 5
to level 20 or more. The power level determines the player
characters’ starting power points and exactly where you can
spend them. See Power Level later in this chapter for details.

chapter). They have no Fortitude defense.

they are alive).

Presence: Creatures without Presence are unable to
interact and immune to interaction skills. They have
no Will defense.

Lacking an ability is –10 power points; that is, it gives the
character  an  additional  10  power  points  to  spend  else-
where,  similar  to  having  a  –5  rank  in  an  ability,  but  with
different  effects.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  heroes  cannot  be
absent an ability without Gamemaster permission, as it can
have significant effects on the character and the game.

Fighting: A creature with no Fighting is incapable of
making any sort of close attack (but may still be able
to launch ranged attacks, if it has Dexterity).

Absent abilities cannot be weakened (see the Weaken ef-
fect in the Powers chapter) or debilitated, since they are
not present at all in the first place!

Intellect: A creature with no Intellect is an automa-
ton, lacking free will and operating entirely on simple
instinct  or  pre-programmed  instructions.  Anything
with no Intellect is immune to mental effects and in-
teraction skills and has no Will defense.

pletely unaware and also has no Presence. It is an in-
animate object, not a creature. Objects are immune

bots or zombies have Strength, Agility, and Dexterity, and

their environment or capable of interaction), and Fighting
(if able to make close attacks). They may have Intellect (if
capable  of  independent  thought),  but  have  no  Stamina
(since  they  are  not  living  things).  See  Constructs  in  the

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES
CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

Over  the  course  of  play,  your  hero’s  ability  ranks  may
change for the following reasons:

•

•

Some power effects raise or lower ability ranks (see
the Powers chapter).

You can improve ability ranks permanently by spend-
ing  earned  power  points  on  them,  but  you  cannot
increase  an  ability  rank  above  the  limits  set  by  the
series’ power level (see Power Level, page 24).

Whenever  an  ability  rank  changes,  all  traits  associated
with  the  ability  change  as  well.  So  if  you  increase  your
character’s Agility, his Agility-based skills and Dodge de-
fense  also  increase.  Likewise,  if  the  hero’s  Agility  bonus
decreases, his Agility-based skills and Dodge suffer.

If one of your hero’s ability ranks drops below –5 for any
reason, that ability is said to be debilitated and the char-
acter  suffers  more  serious  effects  than  just  a  penalty  to
certain traits and rolls, as follows:

•

•

•

•

Debilitated  Strength,  Agility,  or  Dexterity  means
the  hero  collapses:  defenseless,  immobilized,  and
stunned (although still conscious and aware).

Debilitated  Stamina  means  the  hero  is  dying,  and
suffers  a  –5  modifier  on  Fortitude  checks  to  avoid
death on top of it.

Debilitated  Fighting  means  the  hero  is  dazed  and
defenseless, and cannot make close attacks.

Debilitated
Intellect,  Awareness,  or  Presence
means the hero is unaware and remains so until re-
stored to at least a –5 rank in the ability.

Debilitated  ability  ranks  usually  result  from  a  power  af-
fecting  your  character.  Ability  ranks  cannot  be  lowered
any further once they are debilitated.

Rather  than  having  a  rank  of  –5  in  a  given  ability,  some
things  or  creatures  actually  lack  an  ability  altogether.
These  beings  automatically  fail  any  check  requiring  the
absent ability. The additional effects of  an  absent ability
are as follows:

•

•

Strength:  A  creature  with  no  Strength  is  incapable
of exerting any physical force, either because it has
no physical form (like an incorporeal ghost) or simply
can’t move (like a tree).

Stamina: A creature with no Stamina has no physical
body (like a ghost) or is not a living being (such as a
robot or other construct). Creatures with no Stamina
suffer  and  recover  from  damage  like  inanimate  ob-
jects  (see  Damaging  Objects  under  the  Damage

something else that looks more interesting). This method
combines  the  best  of  the  two  options  above  because  it
limits your choices, but also allows you to control, to some
extent, what you get.

Important note: No matter which option you use when
creating  a  character,  feel  free  to  alter  the  results  of  your
rolls to make sure you get a character you find interesting.
This is not cheating! Simply because these tables are in this
book doesn’t make them “rules” that you have to “follow.”
Instead, consider them play aids with guidelines to make
it easier to create your character…because that’s exactly
what they are.

Every superhero has challenges that make his or her life
more…interesting. Just like the characters in the comics,
your  hero  needs  at least  two  Complications;  one  should
be  a  Motivation  and  the  other  (or  others)  is  up  to  you.
Each Archetype lists a number of suggestions appropriate
for that Archetype. This is your hero, so take the Compli-
cations  that  make  the  most  sense  to  you.  If  none  of  the
suggestions work for you, there are more Complications
to choose from in Chapter 2.

Once you have your character’s various traits and Compli-
cations determined and on paper, you’re ready to play! Your
character should be appropriate for a Power Level 10 (PL10)
game, so you can start playing right away without changes.

It’s  possible,  however,  that  you  have  an  advantage  that
doesn’t mesh correctly with your skills. For example, you
might get the Daze (Intimidation), Skill Mastery (Technol-
ogy),  or  Assessment  advantages,  each  of  which  requires
a  specific  skill  to  work  correctly:  Intimidation,  Technol-
ogy, and Insight, respectively. If that’s the case, feel free to
choose a different advantage, or if you like the effect the
advantage gives you, swap one of your skills for the one
you need. Instances in which this is a problem should be
rare, but they can happen.

Another aspect of “pulling it all together” is making sure
the character is interesting to you. Do this by customizing
your character a bit, if necessary. This is your hero, after all!
Gamemaster, you should work with your players to swap
around a few points’ worth of Abilities, Advantages, Skills,
and/or  Powers  so  they  end  up  with  a  character  more  to
their liking. Usually, this process is as simple as replacing
ranks  of  one  effect  for

The  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  Quickstart  Character  Gen-
erator found on the following pages first appeared as a
booklet  included  with  the  M&M  Gamemaster’s  Kit.  Our
goal in creating it was to make it easier for new players
and  Gamemasters  to  create  characters.  It  proved  very
popular and when we had the chance, we offered up the
idea  of  including  an  updated  version  of  it  in  the  Hero’s
Handbook to the fans and their response was a resound-
ing, “Yes!”

This updated version of the Quickstart Character Genera-
tor includes clearer instructions, some new powers and
options for some of the archetypes, and fixes to a couple
of the archetypes to make sure they didn’t break any of
the rules.

HEROES

The  character  generator  allows  players  to  quickly  create
power level 10 starting characters. Using these tables, new
players can start playing their new hero in mere minutes.
All they need to do is roll a d20 to find out what Archetype
they  get,  then  roll  on  the  tables  for  that  Archetype  and
write  everything  down  on  a  character  sheet  or  piece  of
paper and they’re set!

Sure, this method removes a lot of choice from the pro-
cess,  but  that  speeds  up  character  creation,  since  the
player doesn’t have to make every single decision along
the way (or even know the rules!). It can also provide some
much-needed inspiration to a player who doesn’t have a
strong idea for a new hero. Experienced players may not
need to randomly generate characters, but they may still
want to. The results from the random tables can be inter-
esting in ways a carefully conceived and planned charac-
ter is not.

Finally,  the  Gamemaster  can  use  these  tables  to  quickly
come up with a villain or NPC hero. Randomly roll a char-
acter or pick the Archetype and powers that best fit the
needs  of  the  story  and  within  moments  the  character  is
ready to go!

No  matter  how  Gamemasters  and  players  end  up  using
the Quickstart Character Generator, it should make starting
a game easier, faster, and more fun.

There are a few different ways to use the character gen-
erator.  Gamemasters  and  players  should  agree  on  the
method  they’re  using  before  beginning,  and  work  with
each  other  during  the  process  to  make  sure  the  end  re-
sult is agreeable. After all, you’re here to have fun, so your
main goal should be to ma

The Totem is a superhero whose powers are closely tied to
a particular animal. The Totem may have acquired its pow-
ers  through  an  accident  of  science,  an  invocation  of  the
animal spirits, or may even be an exceptional, self-aware
animal. Totem heroes tend to be as varied as the animals
they represent, and they can resemble other archetypes
such as the Martial Artist, Warrior, and Powerhouse.

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Damage, Reaction • 4 points per rank

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You can surround your body with an aura of damaging
energy or some similar effect. Anyone you touch or that
touches you must make a Toughness resistance check
against your aura’s Damage rank. You can turn your aura
on and off at will as a free action. If your Aura damages
some targets but not others, apply the Selective or Lim-
ited modifiers (depending on whether or not the selec-
tivity is under your control).

Reduced Trait: One or more of your traits is lowered while
others  are  enhanced. This  flaw  is  worth  as  many  points
as  the  reduction  in  the  affected  trait(s).  So,  for  example,
if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the
value  of  the  lost  Intellect  ranks  as  the  value  of  the  flaw.
As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power
point. Flat –points equal to the lowered trait.

You can generate and project a type of energy, such as
cold, electricity, fire, kinetic force, magnetism, radiation,
or  even  cosmic  energy,  in  a  damaging  blast  (see  the
Blast power).

Energy Control is further defined by the addition of Alter-
nate Effects (see Alternate Effects, page 188), expand-
ing what you can do with your control. For example, Cold
Control  might  let  you  lower  the  surrounding  tempera-
ture (Environment – Cold) or trap targets in ice (Affliction,
see  the  Snare  version).  Magnetic  Control  could  let  you
manipulate metallic objects (Limited Move Object) while
Electrical Control lets you generate an electrical pulse to
overload electronics (Burst Area Nullify Electronics). Add
as many Alternate Effects to your Energy Control as you
can afford, and consider some additional ones as options

larly, you may suffer a circumstance penalty to interaction
when dealing with characters of a strongly differing mo-
tivation.

At the GM’s option motivation can function as a descriptor
for powers (see Descriptors, page 204), allowing character
to  have  a  power  affecting  only  subjects  with  a  particular
motivation,  for  example,  or  the  ability  to  detect  charac-
ters  with  a  particular  motivation  (see  Detect,  page  177).
Gamemasters should be very careful when applying power
modifiers based on subjective qualities like motivation. An
attack  power  affecting  only “evil”  targets,  for  example,  is
useless against inanimate objects, constructs, and animals
(which cannot have such a quality) as well as “good” targets.
It  might  also  not  affect  characters  without  a  specific  evil
motivation (such as selfish mercenaries, violent vigilantes,
or despots devoted solely to order, but not “evil” per se).

Some characters may derive their powers from their mo-
tivation in some way, such as heroes who draw strength
from  their  convictions,  faith,  or  morality. This  provides  a
descriptor for those powers, but the hero may also suffer
Power  Loss  (see  page  28)  from  a  change  or  wavering  in
motivation.

A character with different motivations may find them in
conflict from time to time. Such conflicts provide roleplay-
ing opportunities and complications for players and story
hooks for the Gamemaster. For example, a hero motivated
by Patriotism may discover a secret government agency
acting against the interests of justice in the world. What
is stronger, the hero’s patriotism or the desire to see the
truth known and justice done? Some conflicts may even
result  in  heroes  changing  motivations.  See  Changing
Complications, in the following section, for more on this.

Other  possible  complications,  and  their  uses  in  adven-
tures, include:

•

•

Accident: You cause or suffer some sort of accident.
Perhaps a stray blast damages a building or hurts an
innocent bystander, your fire powers set off sprinkler
systems, or you cause volatile chemicals to explode.
A  hero  with  this  as  a  regular  complication  may  be
especially  accident-prone,  inexperienced  with  their
powers, or even jinxed! The GM decides the effects of
an  accident,  but  they  should  be  troublesome.  Acci-
dents can lead to further complications; perhaps the
hero develops a guilt-complex, obsession, or phobia
involving t

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Descriptors help to bring a collection of effects and modifiers to life, differentiating them from similar (or even identical)
configurations and making them into distinct powers. Although descriptors don’t always have significant game effects
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, they’re perhaps the most important element in providing color and character to the powers
of heroes and villains.

Descriptors do have some affect on game play. In particular, descriptors often govern how certain effects interact
with each other, serving as convenient shorthand to help define an effect’s parameters. For example, Immunity and
Nullify work against effects with specific descriptors; if they were limited solely to things like effect type, it would
leave out a tremendous range of options, like “Immunity to Fire” or “Nullify Mutant Powers,” which are important to
the source material.

Descriptors  come  in  many  different  forms.  The  break-
down in this section is inexact, and deliberately so; some
descriptors fall into more than one category, while others
might not fall into any of these categories, being unique
to  that  particular  character  or  power.  Still,  the  following
are the major types of descriptors suited to MUTANTS & MAS-
powers, and things to consider when creating or
choosing powers for a character.
ORIGIN

A descriptor may relate to the origin of a power, where it
comes  from  or  what  granted  it  to  the  character.  For  ex-
ample, did he gain Speed in a scientific accident or from
years of focused meditation at a secret temple to the God
of Speed? A power’s origin may determine how it interacts
with  other  powers.  Some  powers  with  the  same  origin
might be better suited to counter each other, for example,
or  to  work  in  conjunction,  combining  their  benefits.  Ex-
amples of origin descriptors include:

•

•

•

Accidental powers are the result of random chance
or  accident:  being  struck  by  lightning,  doused  in
chemicals, exposed to exotic radiation, and so forth.
The circumstances of an accidental origin may or may
not  be  something  others  can  duplicate  (although
some are sure to try).

Bestowed powers are granted by an outside agency
of some sort, such as a deity, a technology, an alien
race,  or  another  superhuman. The  process  that  be-
stows  the  powers  can  be  transitory  or  effectively
permanent, barring some sort of plot device or GM-
created setback.

the effect has. The change in cost and effect applies only
to the ranks with the modifier; the unmodified ranks have
their normal cost and effect.

Example:  Caliber’s  micro-rockets  are  a  Damage  7
effect. They also explode on impact, for a Burst Area
Damage  effect,  but  the  Area  Damage  is  only  rank
4. So the first 4 ranks of the Caliber’s Damage effect
have the Burst Area modifier, costing 1 point more (or
3 per rank). The remaining 3 ranks have their usual
cost (2 per rank). Caliber makes a normal ranged at-
tack check against the main target for his micro-rock-
et launcher; if he hits, the target has to resist Damage
7, and everyone within the area around the target re-
sists Damage 4 (the Area Damage). Even if he misses,
the main target has to resist the Area Damage 4, since
the micro-rocket explodes close by! In Caliber’s busi-
ness, it pays to cover your bases...

MODIFIERS

Some modifiers, rather than increasing or decreasing an ef-
fect’s cost per rank, have a flat value in power points, noted
as flat in the modifier’s header. For example, the Subtle extra
costs only 1 or 2 points, depending on how subtle the effect
is. Likewise, the Activation flaw has a flat value of –1 or –2
points, depending on how long the power takes to activate.

Flat-value modifiers are applied to the final cost of an effect,
after its cost per rank and total cost for its number of ranks
is determined. So, for example, if an effect costs 2 points per
rank, with +1 per rank for extras and –2 per rank for flaws.
It has a final adjusted cost of (2 + 1 – 2) or 1 point per rank.
With 8 ranks, it costs 8 power points. If the same effect also
has a flat-value extra costing 2 points and a flat-value flaw
worth –1 point, then you add 2 to the final cost and sub-
tract 1, for a total of (8 points for the effect + 2 points for the
flat extra – 1 point for the flat flaw) or 9 power points.
modified cost + flat extra value -
flat flaw value

tion). When  an  effect  is  used  against  a  corporeal  target,
the effect’s rank is equal to the rank of this extra, up to a
maximum of the effect’s full rank. Characters with lower
ranks  1–3  of  Insubstantial  do  not  require  this  extra  for
their effects to work on the physical world, although they
can apply it to their Strength rank to allow them to exert
some Strength while Insubstantial.

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

Ranged  weapons  include  both  thrown  and  projectile
weapons.  Thrown  weapons  are  Strength-based,  adding
the wielder’s Strength rank to their Damage rank. Projec-
tile weapons include bows, crossbows, and guns as well
as energy weapons like lasers and blasters. Their Damage
is generally not Strength-based.

Like melee weapons, ranged weapons have category, ef-
fect,  critical,  and  cost  traits.  Ranged  weapon  categories
are  Projectile  Weapons,  Energy  Weapons,  Heavy  Weap-
ons, and Thrown Weapons.

Holdout  pistol:  A  low-caliber,  easily  concealed  pistol,
typically used as a back-up or secondary weapon.

Light pistol: A common handgun, found in the hands of
police officers and criminals alike.

Heavy  pistol:  A  high-caliber  handgun,  usually  used  by
those who want a lot of stopping power.

Machine pistol: A small automatic weapon, usable in one
hand.

Submachine gun: Compact automatic weapons that fire
pistol  ammunition,  submachine  guns  are  common  mili-
tary weapons, also used by criminals with access to more
serious firepower.

Shotgun: A shotgun can fire shot, which does Damage 5
with Accurate 1 due to the spread, but Limited to Dam-
age 3 against targets with Protection. It can also load solid
slugs, which inflict the same damage, but without the Ac-
curate bonus or the Limit on Damage.

Assault rifle: Rifles designed for military-use capable of
both single-fire and automatic fire.

Sniper rifle: Rifles designed for long-range use, typically
in conjunction with a powerful scope or targeting system.

Bow: Although outdated, some heroes and villains favor the
bow as a weapon and it can be quite effective in the right
hands. A bow-wielding character may have various “trick” ar-
rows with different powers, typically handled as devices.

Crossbow: Similar to a bow, and used for the same reasons.

Blaster pistol: A pistol that fires a coherent bolt of energy.

Blaster rifle: A larger rifle-sized weapon that fires a more
powerful bolt of energy.

Taser: A compressed-air weapon firing a pair of darts. On
impact  they  release  a  powerful  electrical  charge,  for  an
Affliction effect that can daze, stun, or incapacitate (For-
titude resistance, DC 15).

Flamethrower: A flamethrower shoots a stream or arc of
fire Damage as Cone or Line Area and can switch between
settings as an Alternate Effect.

Grenade  launcher:  A  grenade  launcher  fires  various
types of grenades out a greater distance, gener

also  Penetrating,  to  help  overcome  Impervious  armor
Protection,  although  the  rocket’s  Damage  typically  does
most of that work. Most rocket launchers can fire only one
or two shots before they must be reloaded (standard ac-
tion, meaning the launcher cannot fire that turn).

Bolos: A set of weighted cords intended to entangle an
opponent  with  a  Snare  Affliction  that  hinders  and  im-
pedes, then renders the target defenseless and immobile.
See Snare in the Powers chapter for details.

Boomerang: A common throwing weapon for heroes, a
thrown boomerang returns to the thrower’s hand, ready
to be thrown again on the next round (less a Feature and
more a special descriptor). Boomerang wielders often use
this  property  of  the  weapon  to  feint,  allowing  for  an  at-
tack against a vulnerable target on the return arc on the
attacker’s next turn.

Javelin: Light, flexible spears intended to be thrown. Jav-
elins can also be used in melee combat.

Shuriken: Flat metal stars or spikes for throwing. Shuriken
can be thrown in groups as a Multiattack. Although they
are  thrown  weapons,  shuriken  are  not  Strength-based,
being too light.

The following accessories can be added to the projectile
weapons in this section. Each is considered a feature cost-
ing 1 equipment point.

beam showing where the weapon is aimed. This grants a

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Ranged, Progressive Affliction, Resisted by Forti-
tude • 4 points per rank

You  render  the  target  unable  to  breathe.  Targets  fail-
ing  the  Fortitude  resistance  check  against  your  effect
DC become dazed, stunned, and finally incapacitated,
passing out from the lack of oxygen. A failed attempt
to  resist  the  ongoing  effect  of  Suffocation  causes  the
target’s condition to worsen by one degree.

ent than “heat ray” is a descriptor for a Damage effect or
“sticky webbing” is a descriptor for a hindering Affliction;
in  neither  case  does  the  character  need  Summon  Heat
Ray or Summon Webbing to create the desired powers!

SWIMMING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-
scribe it, such as “inside the capitol building lobby” or “atop
the  Emerald  Tower’s  roof.”  If  the  destination  isn’t  in  your
Teleport range, nothing happens. +1 cost per rank.

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

•

Identity:  The  Paragon  often  hides  his  or  her  true
identity  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Often  the  Para-
gon feels that this “normal” identity keeps him or her
grounded and in touch with the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: The Paragon is motivat-
ed to be a hero because it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  The  Paragon  is  a  patriot
and fights to uphold the ideals of his or her country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Paragon  is  often
motivated  by  the  belief  that  with  power  comes  re-
sponsibility.

•

•

•

Power  Loss:  Usually  caused  by  transforming  back
to a normal human form, some Paragons lack access
to  their  powers  all  the  time.  If  you  choose  this  op-
tion, create a non-powered version of your character
that doesn’t have any of its Powers, has human-level
Abilities, and may even have lower ranks of Skills and
completely different Advantages.

Prejudice:  Some  Paragons  are  appear  inhuman  in
some way and are treated with distrust or fear by the
public.

Relationship:  Paragons  often  have  a  large  number
of  friends,  family,  or  fans  that  get  into  trouble  with
alarming frequency.

•  Weakness: Because the Paragon is so powerful in so
many ways, he or she often suffers from a crippling
weakness to a particular type of attack.

The Powerhouse is the strongest one there is! Where other
archetypes spread their points out amongst a number of
different  powers  and  abilities,  the  Powerhouse  concen-
trates  on  two  things:  strength  and  protection.  In  fights,
the Powerhouse is always on the front line, tearing it up
and,  even  so,  is  usually  the  last  one  standing. The  Pow-
erhouse  is  often  inhuman-looking,  either  because  he  or
she’s been turned into a hulking brute, or is from an alien
world, or is capable of transforming into living stone, steel,
or something equally resistant to damage.

Battlesuits  typically  fall  into  one  of  three  categories:
they’re either ranged combatants, melee powerhouses, or
a mix of the two. No matter what role the Battlesuit fills,

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

You can use combinations of advantages—particularly combat advantages—to create different “fighting styles” rang-
ing from martial arts to superhero combat techniques. For example, a “soft” fighting style focusing primarily on defense
might include the advantages Defensive Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Trip, and Instant Up. A “hard” fighting style
focused on offense might include All-out Attack, Improved Critical, Improved Smash, Power Attack, and Startle for a fierce
kiai shout! You can combine various advantages to create specific styles or allow players to mix-and-match to design their
own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet
mastered a style may have only some of a style’s associated advantages rather than all of them.

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

•

•

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

is one degree of success, just as a result of 8 is one degree
of failure.

There is no limit to the number of degrees a check may have,
although more than two degrees of failure rarely matters,
and some degrees of success may have no further effect be-
yond a certain point (once you have succeeded as well as
is possible in a given situation). For example, failure on an
Acrobatics check to balance means you wobble and spend
that  turn  maintaining  your  balance,  but  don’t  move. Two
degrees of failure mean you lose your balance and fall! After
that point, further degrees of failure don’t really matter.

In cases where a single degree of success or failure is suffi-
cient, the rules simply specify “success” or “failure” without
giving a degree.

Specific types of graded checks—notably skill and resis-
tance checks—give specific results for degrees of success
and failure in their descriptions.

Some circumstances make checks easier or harder, result-
ing in a bonus or penalty to the check. Characters in a fa-
vorable situation are said to have a circumstance bonus
for the check, while those in a disadvantageous situation
are said to be have a circumstance penalty.

As  a  general  rule,  apply  a  modifier  of  plus  or  minus  2  if
the character is at a minor bonus or minor penalty, and
a modifier of plus or minus 5 if the character is at a major
bonus or major penalty for the check:

Technically,  circumstance  modifiers  could  apply  to  ei-
ther the check result of the difficulty class of a check, af-
fecting the character’s performance, or making the task
itself  easier  or  harder.  If  you  want  to  differentiate  be-
tween circumstance modifiers that affect performance
versus those that modify the difficulty of a task, feel free
to  do  so.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  applies  circumstance
modifiers directly to the check result because it is easier
to deal with them consistently, and the game effect is
the same: the chance of success changes.

Circumstance  modifiers  are  another  useful  Gamemas-
ter  tool  for  handling  a  lot  of  the  variables  that  come
up  during  game  play.  Specific  examples  are  discussed
throughout  the  rules  for  various  types  of  checks.  One
example includes the following:
TOOLS

Some  tasks  require  tools.  If  tools  are  needed,  the  spe-
cific items are mentioned in the description of the task
or skill. If you don’t have the appropria

A “—” entry in the Action column means using the skill typically takes longer than a standard action. See the skill description for details.
* Some areas of Expertise can be used Untrained. See the entry on Expertise for more information.

Interaction: If “Interaction” is included on the line below
the skill’s name, it is an interaction skill.

Manipulation:  If “Manipulation”  is  included  on  the  line
below the skill’s name, it is a manipulation skill.

Requires Tools: If “Requires Tools” is included on the line
below the skill’s name, you need to have the proper tools
to use the skill. Not having the proper tools is a –5 circum-
stance penalty to the skill check (see Circumstance Modi-
fiers, page 15).

The skill name line is followed by a description of the skill
and how it is used.

Agility • Trained Only

Use Acrobatics to flip, dive, roll, tumble, and perform other
acrobatic maneuvers, as well as keeping your balance un-
der difficult circumstances.
BALANCING

You  can  keep  your  balance  and  move  along  a  precari-
ous  surface  at  your  ground  speed  minus  1  rank  with  a
successful  Acrobatics  check  against  the  surface’s  DC.  A
degree of failure indicates you spend your move action
just maintaining your balance and do not actually move,
while  two  or  more  degrees  of  failure  means  you  lose
your balance and fall.

word, “Energy,” or “Energy Control type,” above.

An  Energy  Controller’s  personality  often  reflect  the
energy type he or she controls, so the descriptions for
Abilities, Advantages, and Skills can help narrow down
which energy type fits your character if you prefer to as-
sign one to your hero.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

107

Here are descriptions of the eight abilities and what they represent.

STRENGTH (STR)

INTELLECT (INT)

Strength measures sheer muscle power and the ability to
apply it. Your Strength rank applies to:

•

Damage dealt by your unarmed and strength-based
attacks.
How far you can jump (based on an Athletics skill check).
The amount of weight you can lift, carry, and throw.
Athletics skill checks.

•
•
•
STAMINA (STA)

Stamina  is  health,  endurance,  and  overall  physical  resil-
ience.  Stamina  is  important  because  it  affects  a  charac-
ter’s ability to resist most forms of damage. Your Stamina
modifier applies to:

•
•

•

Toughness defense, for resisting damage.
Fortitude defense, for resisting effects targeting your
character’s health.
Stamina  checks  to  resist  or  recover  from  things  af-
fecting  your  character’s  health  when  a  specific  de-
fense doesn’t apply.

AGILITY (AGL)

Agility is balance, grace, speed, and overall physical coor-
dination. Your Agility rank applies to:

•

•
•
•

Dodge defense, for avoiding ranged attacks and oth-
er hazards.
Initiative bonus, for acting first in combat.
Acrobatics and Stealth skill checks.
Agility  checks  for  feats  of  coordination,  gross  move-
ment, and quickness when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

DEXTERITY (DEX)

Dexterity  is  a  measure  of  hand-eye  coordination,  preci-
sion, and manual dexterity. Your Dexterity rank applies to:

•
•
•

Attack checks for ranged attacks.
Sleight of Hand and Vehicles skill checks.
Dexterity  checks  for  feats  of  fine  control  and  preci-
sion when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

FIGHTING (FGT)

Fighting  measures  your  character’s  ability  in  close  com-
bat, from hitting a target to ducking and weaving around
any counter-attacks. Your Fighting rank applies to:

•
•

Attack checks for close attacks.
Parry defense, for avoiding close attacks.

Intellect covers reasoning ability and learning. A character
with a high Intellect rank tends to be knowledgeable and
well-educated. Your Intellect modifier applies to:

•

•

Expertise,  Investigation, Technology,  and Treatment
skill checks.
Intellect checks to solve problems using sheer brain-
power when a specific skill doesn’t apply.

AWARENESS (AWE)

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

provides a framework for your imagination. It has rules to help determine what happens in your
stories and to resolve conflicts between characters and the challenges they face. With it, you can experience adventure
as a hero fighting against the forces of evil! Any adventure you can imagine is possible.

Like all games, MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS has rules. This chapter looks at the basic rules of the game and how they work,
giving you the foundation upon which the rest of the game is built.

uses a standard, or “core,” game me-
chanic to resolve actions. Whenever a character attempts
an action with a chance of failure, do the following:

•

•

•

Roll a twenty-sided die (or d20).

Add any relevant modifiers (for game traits like abili-
ties, skills, powers, or circumstances) to the number
rolled.

Compare  the  total  to  a  number  called  a  difficulty
class (abbreviated DC).

If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class (set by the
GM  based  on  the  circumstances),  the  effort  succeeds.  If
the result is lower than the difficulty class, it fails.

This simple mechanic is used for nearly everything in MU-
MASTERMINDS, with variations based on what modi-
fiers are made to the roll, what determines the difficulty
class, and the exact degree of success and failure. Remem-
ber...

d20 + modifiers vs. difficulty class

... and you understand how to play most of the game!

One of the players in a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game takes
the  role  of  Gamemaster  (abbreviated  GM).  The  Game-
master is responsible for running the game—a combina-
tion  of  writer,  director,  and  referee.  The  GM  creates  the
adventures for the heroes, portrays the villains and sup-
porting characters, describes the world to the players, and
decides the outcome of the heroes’ actions based on the
roll of the die and the guidelines given in the rules. It’s a
big  job,  but  also  a  rewarding  one,  since  the  Gamemas-
ter gets to develop the world and all the characters in it,
along with inventing fun and exciting stories.

If  you’re  going  to  be  the  Gamemaster,  you  should  read
through this whole book carefully. You should have a firm
grasp of the rules, since you’re expected to interpret them
for the players to help decide what happens in the game.
You’ll  also  help  the  players  develop  their  own  heroes,
making sure they fit into the world and have potential for
exciting stories in their own right.

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

COMBAT

You  can  make  grab  attacks  with  only  one  arm,  leaving
the other free. You can also maintain the grab while using
your other hand to perform actions. You are not vulner-
able while grabbing (see Grabbing in the Action & Ad-
venture chapter).

COMBAT

Your grab attacks are particularly difficult to escape. Op-
ponents  you  grab  suffer  a  –5  circumstance  penalty  on
checks to escape.

COMBAT, RANKED

You have a +4 bonus to your initiative checks per rank in
this advantage.

COMBAT

You have no penalty to attack checks to hit an object held
by another character (see Smash in the Action & Adven-
ture chapter).

COMBAT

You  have  no  penalty  to  your  attack  check  to  trip  an  op-
ponent and they do not get the opportunity to trip you.
When  making  a  trip  attack,  make  an  opposed  check  of
your Acrobatics or Athletics against your opponent’s Ac-

robatics  or  Athletics,  you  choose  which  your  opponent
uses to defend, rather than the target choosing (see Trip
in the Action & Adventure chapter). This is a good martial
arts advantage for unarmed fighters.

SKILL

You ignore the circumstance penalty for using skills with-
out proper tools, since you can improvise sufficient tools
with whatever is at hand. If you’re forced to work without
tools at all, you suffer only a –2 penalty.

COMBAT, RANKED

When  wielding  an  improvised  close  combat  weapon—
anything from a chair to a telephone pole or entire car—
you use your Close Combat: Unarmed skill bonus for at-
tack checks with the “weapon” rather than relying on your
general Close Combat skill bonus. Additional ranks in this
advantage give you a +1 bonus to Damage with impro-
vised weapons per rank. Your maximum Damage bonus is
still limited by power level, as usual.

INSPIRE

FORTUNE, RANKED (5)

You can inspire your allies to greatness. Once per scene, by
taking a standard action and spending a hero point, allies
able to interact with you gain a +1 circumstance bonus per
Inspire rank on all checks until the start of your next round,
with a maximum bonus of +5. You do not gain the bonus,
only  your  allies  do.  The  inspiration  bonus  ignores  power

ledge, tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM
sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneu-
ver,  while  failure  means  you  do  not,  and  two  or  more
degrees  of  failure  usually  means  you  slip  and  end  up
prone (and may suffer additional effects, depending on
the stunt). A successful acrobatic maneuver may provide
you a circumstance bonus on certain follow-up actions,
if the GM sees fit.

STANDING

You can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to go from prone
to standing as a free action rather than a move action. A
failed check means you remain prone.

TUMBLING

You can make an Acrobatics check (DC 5) to lessen dam-
age from a fall, reducing the damage by 1 per degree. A
fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you
quickly roll to your feet as a free action. Otherwise, you are
prone at the end of a fall.

CLIMBING

With a successful Athletics check, you can climb along a

rank minus 2 as a move action. A perfectly smooth, flat,
vertical surface can’t be climbed without the Wall-crawl-
ing effect of Movement (see the Powers chapter).

A failed Athletics check indicates you make no progress,
and  two  or  more  degrees  of  failure  means  you  fall  from
whatever  height  you  attained  (unless  you  are  secured
with a safety harness or other equipment). Make an Ath-

Power Effect

Escaping from a grab is an Acrobatics or Athletics check.
See Grab in the Conflict section and Contorting, previ-
ously, for details.

Minor feats of sleight of hand, such as making a coin or
playing card “vanish,” have a DC of 10 unless an observer
is focused on noticing what you are doing. When you per-
form this skill under observation, your check is opposed
by  the  observer’s  Perception  check  to  see  if  they  notice
the trick.
STEALING

To covertly take something from another person make a
Sleight of Hand check (DC 20). Your target makes a Per-
ception check and notices the attempt if his check result
beats  yours,  whether  you  succeed  in  taking  the  object
or not.

You can also make a Sleight of Hand check to plant a small
object on someone, slip something into their pocket, drop
something into their drink, place a tiny radio tracer on them,
and so forth. To plant the object, you must get a check result
of  20  or  higher,  regardless  of  the  opponent’s  check  result.
The opponent notices the attempt if his check result beats
yours, whether you succeed in planting the item or not.

Example:  The  Rubber-Bandit  is  robbing  a  muse-
um of some of its valuables when a security guard
passes  by  while  making  his  rounds.  The  bouncing
Bandit has no fear of the rent-a-cop, so he decides
to have some fun. He has Skill Mastery for his Stealth
and,  unsurprisingly,  the  guard  doesn’t  notice  him
slither closer, but then the Rubber-Bandit decides to
try and steal the guard’s gun without being noticed.
Bandit has Sleight of Hand +12 and adds that to the
roll of a die. A whopping 19 plus 12 for a total of 31!
The guard, with a Perception skill of only +5, doesn’t
have a prayer of noticing his gun being eased out of
its holster, but the GM rolls anyway and gets a total
of 20. A good roll, but no enough.

STEALTH

Agility

You’re skilled in going unnoticed. While using Stealth, you
can  move  at  your  speed  rank  minus  1  with  no  penalty.
Faster than that, up to your full speed, you take a –5 cir-
cumstance penalty to your Stealth checks.

suffer any damage from landing after a jump, so long as it
is within your maximum distance.

Continuous:  Extending  the  effect’s  duration  to  continu-
ous allows you to remain Insubstantial until you choose to
return to your corporeal form. +1 cost per rank.

Innate: Use this modifier if your character’s form is natu-
rally  or  innately  Insubstantial,  particularly  if  the  effect  is
permanent in duration. Flat +1 point.

Precise: This modifier allows you to selectively make some
portions of your body insubstantial while keeping others
substantial (or vice versa). This allows you to do things like
reach through a wall, solidify your hand to pick up an ob-
ject  or  tap  someone  on  the  shoulder  (or  punch  them  in
the face), and become incorporeal again to withdraw it on
the following round. Flat +1 point.

Progressive:  You  can  assume  lower  ranked  forms  of  In-
substantial, but you must progress through them in order
to reach the higher-ranked ones. For example if you have
Progressive Insubstantial 3, you can assume fluid, gaseous,
or energy forms, but to assume energy form, you must first
progress through fluid and gaseous, becoming less and less
substantial. Since you can only activate the effect once per
turn, it takes you three turns to get there. +0 cost per rank.

Reaction: Becoming Insubstantial is normally a free action,
meaning  you  can’t  switch  to  an  Insubstantial  form  when
surprised or otherwise unable to take action. At the GM’s
option, applying the Action extra to use Insubstantial as a
reaction allows you to switch forms “reflexively” in response
to such hazards, even if it is not your turn. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle:  This  extra  makes  your  Insubstantial  nature  less
noticeable  to  observers.  Rank  1  requires  a  Perception
check (DC 20) to detect that you are Insubstantial, while 2
ranks mean you look entirely normal in Insubstantial form
(which may cause opponents to waste effort on you, not
knowing  you  are  immune  to  their  attacks,  for  example).
Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Absent Strength: This flaw applies only to rank 1 Insub-
stantial and removes your effective Strength while in that
form, leaving you with limited ability to affect the physical
world like the higher ranks of the effect. Flat –1 point.

less than ideal conditions. This section details some of the
hazards heroes may face.

FALLING

Criminals  often  lurk  in  the  darkness,  and  many  crimes
take  place  at  night.  Most  cities  are  lit  well  enough,  but
sometimes  heroes  run  into  areas  where  it’s  difficult  to
see. Poorly lit areas provide concealment. Characters with
Counters Concealment (Darkness) Senses or other appro-
priate Senses effects can ignore concealment penalties for
poor lighting.

Intense  heat  and  cold  wear  down  characters,  while  pro-
longed exposure to the elements can be extremely dan-
gerous.

Characters in hot or cold conditions must make Fortitude
checks (DC 10, +1 per previous check) to avoid becoming
fatigued.  Fatigued  characters  who  fail  a  check  become
exhausted, then incapacitated, at which point the charac-
ter’s condition becomes dying after another failed Forti-
tude check.

How  often  characters  have  to  make  Fortitude  checks  de-
pends on the conditions. Once an hour for uncomfortable
heat or cold (a hot summer day or cold winter day), once
per 10 minutes for intense heat or cold (a blazing desert or
arctic conditions), once a minute for extreme heat or cold
like the edge of a volcano or an arctic winter storm. Checks
are made at the end of each period of exposure. Truly in-
tense heat or cold—such as a blast furnace or touching liq-
uid nitrogen—inflicts direct damage like an attack.

Characters with the appropriate Immunity do not need to
make Fortitude checks for extreme temperatures.

Heroes  can  go  without  water  for  a  day.  After  this,  they
need to make a Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous
check) each hour to avoid a level of fatigue. Heroes can go
without food for three days. After this, they must make a
Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each day
to  avoid  fatigue.  The  character  cannot  recover  until  he
gets  water  or  food.  Heroes  with  Immunity  to  Starvation
can go an unlimited time without food or water.

Characters can hold their breath for ten rounds (one min-
ute) plus a number of rounds equal to twice their Stamina.
After that time they must make a Fortitude check (DC 10)
each round to continue holding their breath. The DC in-
creases  by  +1  for  each  previous  success.  Failure  on  the
Fortitude  check  means  the  character  becomes  incapaci-
tated . On the following round the character is dying. A dy-
ing character cannot stabilize until

a hero has Agility 6 and is trained in Acrobatics (with a rank
of 7) then the character’s bonus for checks involving feats
of agility covered by Acrobatics is 13 (6 plus 7). Obviously,
training in a skill makes characters more effective at checks
involving that skill, often much more.

For details on what skills are available and what they do,
see the Skills chapter.

Halfway between skills and powers, advantages are minor
benefits characters have, allowing them to do things oth-
ers cannot. They range from special combat maneuvers to
things like financial resources, contacts, and so forth.

Many advantages have no rank, or rather just one rank; a
character either has the advantage (and the benefits that
it grants) or does not. Other advantages may have multiple
ranks, like abilities and skills, measuring their effectiveness.

For details on the various advantages and what they pro-
vide, see the Advantages chapter.

When  using  the  Measurements  Table,  there  are  a  few
important things to keep in mind:

•

•

•

Each rank represents a range of measures. Time
rank  4  is  actually  all  measures  between  1  and  2
minutes, and time rank 16 is everything between 2
and 4 days! So if you’re looking for a measurement
that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one
that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than
8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance
rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).

Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.
In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed
14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds.
You can extend the negative side the Measurement
Table just like you can the positive side, with each
lower  rank  halving  the  previous  measurement.  So
rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3
inches, for example.

Don’t directly add ranks.  Putting  rank  4  distance
together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance!
Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6
is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements,
you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the
ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you
have different ranks, it is best to either handle them
separately  or  convert  them  to  measurements,  add
the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank
7 distance (around half a mile).

•  Measurements  are  approximate.  Especially  at
the higher end, where eac

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

Time Rank = Distance Rank - Speed Rank

Reversing  the  previous  formula,  we  can  also  figure  out
how long it takes someone at a particular speed to cov-
er  a  given  distance,  by  subtracting  the  speed  rank  from
the distance rank to get a time rank. So a normal human
(speed  0)  walking  30  miles  (distance  13)  takes  about  16
hours. A hero with Speed 14 covers the same distance in
(13 – 14 = –1) just 3 seconds!

Throwing Distance Rank =
Strength Rank - Mass Rank

As  another  example,  the  distance  rank  a  hero  can  throw
something equals the hero’s Strength rank minus the mass
rank of the object. So a hero with Strength 10 (able to lift 25
tons), picks up a 10-ton truck (mass rank 9). Since 10-9=1,
the hero can then toss the truck rank 1 distance (60 feet)!

GAME PLAY

A session of the MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game resembles an issue of a comic book or an episode of an animated series.
The Gamemaster and the players get together and tell a story through the process of playing the game. The length of
the game session can vary, from just a couple hours to several hours or more. Some adventures may be completed in a
single session while others may take multiple sessions, just as some comic book stories are told in one issue while others
span multiple issues, forming a story arc or mini-series. The episodic nature of the game allows you to choose when to
stop playing and allows you to start up again at any time you and your friends want.

Also like a comic book, a M&M game consists of a series of interrelated scenes. Some scenes are fairly straightforward,
with the heroes interacting with each other and the supporting cast. In these cases the GM generally just asks the play-
ers to describe what their heroes are doing and in turn describes how the other characters react and what they do. There
may be some improvisational acting as everyone plays out the roles of their characters. When the action starts hap-
pening, such as when the heroes are staving off a disaster or fighting villains, time becomes more crucial and is broken
down into action rounds, and the players generally have to make die rolls to see how their heroes do.

CHECKS

Your hero stands perched on the rooftop, looking down
through the skylight. In the abandoned warehouse below,
the  villain  throws  the  switch  that  begins  lowering  your
hero’s friends into the vat of boiling acid! You turn to the
Gamemaster and say:

ground  speed  minus  one  rank,  if  you  choose.  If  you  fail,
you are still grabbed.

GRAB

You  attempt  to  grab  a  target.  Make  an  attack  check
against the target. If successful, the target makes a resis-
tance check against your Strength (or the rank of a grab-
bing effect) using the better of Strength or Dodge. If you
win with one degree of success, the target is restrained
(immobile  and  vulnerable). Two  or  more  degrees  leave
your  opponent  bound  (defenseless,  immobile,  and  im-
paired).  You  can  attempt  to  improve  an  existing  hold
with another grab action on a following turn. Any result-
ing  degrees  of  success  are  cumulative,  but  if  you  lose,
the target escapes.

You  are  hindered  and  vulnerable  while  grabbing  and
holding an opponent. You can maintain a successful grab
as a free action each turn, but cannot perform other ac-
tions requiring the use of your grabbing limb(s) while do-
ing so. Since maintaining a grab is a free action, you can
take a standard action to inflict your Strength damage to
a grabbed target on subsequent turns after the grab is es-
tablished.

You can drag a restrained or bound target along with you
when  you  move.  The  target  gets  a  Strength  resistance
check  against  your  Strength.  If  it  fails,  you  move  and  the
target moves along with you. If the target resists, you are
immobilized that turn unless you release your hold on the
target.

You can end a grab (releasing your target) as a free action.
If you are unable to take the free action maintain the hold,
the target is automatically released. A target can attempt
to escape from a grab as a move action (see Escape).

MOVE

You can move up to your normal speed rank in any move-
ment mode available to you as a move action. Normally
this is rank 0 ground speed for most people (up to 30 feet).
If  you  choose  to  move  twice  on  your  turn  (taking  two
move actions) then you move your speed rank each time.
You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to
run faster: one or more degree of success increases your
ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

READY

Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you
would normally act on your initiative, but before your ini-
tiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so
you can move as well.

If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed
your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied ac-
tion, y

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

Heroes are more than just skilled, they often have amazing advantages, beyond the abilities of ordinary people. In MU-
MASTERMINDS, advantages often allow heroes to “break the rules,” gaining access to and doing things most people
cannot, or simply doing them better.

Advantages are rated in ranks and bought with power points, just like abilities and skills. Advantages cost 1 power point
per rank. Some advantages have no ranks and are acquired only once, effectively at rank 1.
Advantage Cost = 1 power point per advantage rank

Each advantage’s description explains the benefit it provides. It also says if the advantage can be acquired in ranks and
the effects of doing so. Such advantages are listed as “Ranked” alongside the advantage name. Ranks in a advantage are
noted with a number after the advantage’s name, such as “Defensive Roll 2” (for a character who has taken two ranks
in the Defensive Roll advantage), just like skill and power ranks. If there is a maximum number of ranks a character can
take, it’s listed in parentheses after the word “Ranked” in the advantage’s heading.

Advantages are categorized as one of four types:

•

•

•

•

Combat  Advantages  are  useful  in  combat  and  of-
ten modify how various combat maneuvers are per-
formed.

Fortune  Advantages  require  and  enhance  the  use
of hero points.

General Advantages provide special abilities or bo-
nuses not covered by the other categories.

Skill Advantages offer bonuses or modifications to
skill use.

Each advantage is listed by name, type, and if the advan-
tage is available in multiple ranks, followed by a descrip-
tion of the advantage’s benefits. The effects of additional
ranks  of  the  advantage  (if  any)  are  noted  in  the  text  of
each advantage. In some cases a advantage’s description
mentions  the  normal  conditions  for  characters  who  do
not have the advantage for comparison.

COMBAT

When you make an accurate attack (see Maneuvers, page
249) you can take a penalty of up to –5 on the effect modi-
fier of the attack and add the same number (up to +5) to
your attack bonus.

SKILL

You can use your Acrobatics bonus or movement speed
rank in place of Deception to feint and trick in combat as if
your skill bonus or speed rank were your Deception bonus
(see the Deception skill description). Your opponent op-
poses the attempt with Acrobatics or Insight (whichever
is better).

any attack made on you until the start of your next turn.
Add  10  to  any  roll  of  10  or  less  that  you  make  on  these
checks, just as if you spent a hero point (thus ensuring a
minimum  roll  of  11). The  attacker  must  equal  or  exceed
your opposed check result in order to hit you.

DELAY

NO ACTION

When you delay, you choose to take your turn later in the
initiative order. You must delay your entire turn. You can-
not delay if you have already taken an action on your turn,
or if you are unable to take actions.

At any point after any other character in the conflict has
acted,  you  can  choose  to  take  your  turn.  Your  initiative
moves into the new place in the order where you act, and
you take your normal allocation of actions. If you do not
act before your initiative comes up in the next round, your
turn ends, you lose your delayed turn, and your initiative
remains where it is.

Beneficial effects lasting until the end of your turn end
when you choose to delay, but harmful effects that last
until  the  end  of  your  turn  last  until  after  you  act.  Like-
wise, you do not make resistance checks until after you
have taken your turn, so delaying can draw out some ef-
fects.

DISARM

You attempt to knock an item—such as a weapon or de-
vice—out of an opponent’s grasp. Make an attack check

against the defender with a –2 penalty. If you attempt to
disarm with a ranged attack, you are at –5 penalty. If your
attack succeeds, make an opposed check of your attack’s
damage  against  the  defender’s  Strength.  If  you  win,  the
defender dropped the held object. If you made the disarm
unarmed, you can grab the dropped object as a free ac-
tion. If you make a disarm attempt with a melee weapon
and lose the opposed check, the defender may immedi-
ately make an attempt to disarm you as a reaction; make
another opposed damage vs. Strength check. If this dis-
arm attempt fails, you do not, however, get an additional
attempt to disarm the defender.

Dropping a held item is a free action (although dropping
or  throwing  an  item  with  the  intention  of  hitting  some-
thing with it is a standard attack action).

Dropping  to  a  prone  position  is  a  free  action,  although
getting up requires a move action (see Stand).

You attempt to escape from a successful grab (see Grab).

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

LITERACY

Characters are assumed to be literate in their native language and any other language they know. At the GM’s discretion,
characters may have to spend an additional Languages rank to be literate in a language with a different alphabet or style
of writing from the character’s native language (such as Arabic, Japanese kanji or Russian Cyrillic for an English speaker).
Completely illiterate characters are faced with a potential Disability complication during the game.

level limits, like other uses of hero points. Multiple uses of
Inspire do not stack, only the highest bonus applies.

JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES

SKILL

GENERAL

You can go from prone to standing as a free action with-
out the need for an Acrobatics skill check.

INTERPOSE

GENERAL

Once  per  round,  when  an  ally  within  range  of  your  nor-
mal movement is hit by an attack, you can choose to place
yourself between the attacker and your ally as a reaction,
making  you  the  target  of  the  attack  instead. The  attack
hits  you  rather  than  your  ally,  and  you  suffer  the  effects
normally. You cannot use this advantage against area ef-
fects or perception range attacks, only those requiring an
attack check.

INVENTOR

SKILL

You can use the Technology skill to create inventions. See
Inventing, page 211, for details.

You can use any skill untrained, even skills or aspects of
skills  that  normally  cannot  be  used  untrained,  although
you must still have proper tools if the skill requires them.

LANGUAGES

SKILL, RANKED

You  can  speak  and  understand  additional  languages.
With one rank in this advantage, you know an additional
language. For each additional rank, you double your ad-
ditional  known  languages:  two  at  rank  2,  four  at  rank  3,
eight at rank 4, etc. So a character with Languages 7 is flu-
ent in 64 languages! Characters are assumed to be fluent
in any languages they know, including being able to read
and write in them.

For the ability to understand any language, see the Com-
prehend effect in the Powers chapter.

FORTUNE

Your presence reassures and lends courage to your allies.
As  a  standard  action,  you  can  spend  a  hero  point  to  re-

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Damage, Reaction • 4 points per rank

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You can surround your body with an aura of damaging
energy or some similar effect. Anyone you touch or that
touches you must make a Toughness resistance check
against your aura’s Damage rank. You can turn your aura
on and off at will as a free action. If your Aura damages
some targets but not others, apply the Selective or Lim-
ited modifiers (depending on whether or not the selec-
tivity is under your control).

Reduced Trait: One or more of your traits is lowered while
others  are  enhanced. This  flaw  is  worth  as  many  points
as  the  reduction  in  the  affected  trait(s).  So,  for  example,
if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the
value  of  the  lost  Intellect  ranks  as  the  value  of  the  flaw.
As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power
point. Flat –points equal to the lowered trait.

You can generate and project a type of energy, such as
cold, electricity, fire, kinetic force, magnetism, radiation,
or  even  cosmic  energy,  in  a  damaging  blast  (see  the
Blast power).

Energy Control is further defined by the addition of Alter-
nate Effects (see Alternate Effects, page 188), expand-
ing what you can do with your control. For example, Cold
Control  might  let  you  lower  the  surrounding  tempera-
ture (Environment – Cold) or trap targets in ice (Affliction,
see  the  Snare  version).  Magnetic  Control  could  let  you
manipulate metallic objects (Limited Move Object) while
Electrical Control lets you generate an electrical pulse to
overload electronics (Burst Area Nullify Electronics). Add
as many Alternate Effects to your Energy Control as you
can afford, and consider some additional ones as options
for power stunts (see Powers Stunts, page 20).

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Rank
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–2 points per rank

You  can  change  the  environment  in  an  area:  raising  or
lowering  the  temperature,  creating  light,  causing  rain,
and so forth (see The Environment in the Action & Ad-
venture chapter for details).

Your  Environment  affects  a  30  foot  radius  around  you
at rank 1. Each additional rank moves the radius up one
distance rank, for a reach of approximately 2,000 miles at
rank  20,  sufficient  to  alter  the  environment  of  an  entire
continent!

NotesPowerpointsHeropointsGear & EquipmentMUTANTS & MASTERMINDS

PRINCESS

Julia wants to play a fairly straightforward hero: super-strong and tough, but also a beautiful
young woman with an eye for fashion! She draws a sketch of a smiling, slender woman in a

pink T-shirt that says “Princess” on it in silver sequins, holding a car over her head!

Right off, Julia knows Princess is strong, really strong. So she assigns her Strength 12;
higher than PL10, but still not so high that she can’t also have a reasonable close
combat bonus. That Strength is enough for Princess to lift a hundred tons! She

can heft that car with ease! Julia gives her Stamina 12 to match.

Since she sees Princess as graceful, like a gymnast, Julia gives her Agility
5, but she goes with Dexterity 3, since her character isn’t as coordinated
(although she’s still above average). Likewise, Julia assigns Princess 2 ranks
each  in  Intellect,  Awareness,  and  Presence;  she’s  smart,  sassy,  and  deter-
mined, but not amazingly so. Julia wants Princess to be a capable close-up
fighter, so she gives her Fighting 6. That’s a total of 44 ranks in abilities for 88

power points, leaving 62 remaining.

Next up: powers. Julia wants Princess to be fast and tough. She gives her 4 ranks of
Speed, allowing her to keep up with a slow-moving car, and assigns her 5 ranks in Im-
munity (allowing her to ignore cold, disease, heat, pressure, and radiation) along with some
Impervious Toughness (8 ranks) and Regeneration (2 ranks). That’s 19 points in powers,

43 remaining.

Given her great Strength and Agility, Julia also sees Princess as being able to jump re-
ally far, so she gives her 7 ranks in Leaping as well. That’s another 7 points, leaving 36.

Julia looks over the advantage list, taking notes as she goes. She likes the idea of
Princess being a real toughy: having things like Diehard and Ultimate Tough-
ness,  along  with  Interpose  (allowing  her  to  take  the  hit  for  a  teammate).
But she also wants her to be quick and inspirational. She likes Attractive,
Extraordinary  Effort,  Inspire,  and  Well-informed.  That’s  seven  advan-
tages thus far. She rounds out the list with some combat maneuvers
like All-out Attack and Power Attack (since Princess can cut loose if
she needs to), Improved Initiative (she’s quick) and another rank
of Inspire. That’s another four advantages, for a total of 11 points.

Julia  asks  the  Gamemaster  about  one  more  advantage:

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

As you can see, once you break it down, checks are actual-
ly fairly simple. All the Gamemaster has to say in response
to the player’s declaration is: “Okay, roll a Fighting check
to hit the villain,” letting the rest of the description stand
as what happens. Whether or not the hero is successful in
stopping the trap depends on the outcome of the attack
against the bad guy.

Of course, if the villain is expecting the hero, there might be
another trap, such as part of the catwalk rigged to fall away
under him, leaving him dangling above the acid vat and at
the villain’s mercy! In that case, the GM would respond to
the  player’s  description: “You  smash  through  the  skylight
and swing over to the catwalk, but when you do...” and go
on to describe what follows. The rest of the hero’s intended
action(s) are null and void, because things don’t always go
as planned when you’re dealing with cunning supervillains!

Checks are used to resolve all outcomes in MUTANTS & MAS-
TERMINDS,  so  once  you  understand  the  basic  concept,  the
rest is easy. For detailed examples of how to use checks in
the game and their effects, see the Action & Adventure
chapter.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored a critical success. Determine the degree of success
normally and then increase it by one degree. This can turn
a low-level success into something more significant, but
more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-fledged
success! A critical success with an attack check is called a
critical hit, discussed later in this chapter and in the Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter.

Checks are made against a difficulty class or DC, a num-
ber set by the GM, which your check must equal or exceed
to achieve success. So for a task with a DC of 15 you must
roll a check total of 15 or greater to succeed. In some cas-
es, the results of a check vary based on how much higher
or lower the result is than the DC, known as its degree of
success or failure.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The following archetypes are ready to play for a power level 10 series. Some require a few simple choices or offer options
for customization. Gamemasters can also use these archetypes as ready-made villains, if desired.

The Gadgeteer and Martial Artist rely a great deal on their
advantages (as do other archetypes like the Crime Fighter
and Weapon Master). You’ll want to read the descriptions
of all of the character’s advantages from the Advantages
chapter so you know the benefits they provide. Remem-
ber to make use of them during play to give your charac-
ter every appropriate, well, advantage.

In particular, note how some advantages and even pow-
ers work together. The Gadgeteer can use Quick-Thinking
to speed up the process of inventing (see Inventing, page
211) and Skill Mastery (Technology) to make some invent-
ing  checks  as  routine.  Similarly,  note  the  Martial  Artist’s
Power Attack advantage, good for doing extra damage to
slow, tough, opponents, and the Skill Mastery (Acrobatics)
advantage  for  pulling  off  formidable  (DC  25)  Acrobatics
checks as routine!

The  Mimic  and  Mystic  archetypes  are  both  very  flexible,
although in different ways, and it pays to know what your
character is capable of doing before you are immersed in
the midst of a game.

In the case of the Mimic, the GM may wish to put together
note cards or some other quick reference to the powers of
other characters whom the Mimic might wish to duplicate.
That way, you can see at a glance what traits the character
can copy, and simply hand the card to the player for refer-
ence.  Experienced  Mimics  may  even  build  up  a “hand”  of
such cards they reference often.

For  the  Mystic,  in  addition  to  choosing  your  charac-
ter’s  five  set  Alternate  Effects  (see  Alternate  Effect  on
page  188),  read  the  Magic  sample  power  on  page  168
of the Powers chapter and give some thought to power
stunts your character can do; spur of the moment spells
whipped up to fit a particular need. Mytics are very effec-
tive at power stunts and you might want to reserve a hero
point (or two) for that purpose.

The  Paragon  and  Powerhouse  are  among  the  strongest
archetypes,  able  to  lift  and  carry  a  lot  of  weight.  Just  to
give you an idea, the Paragon can lift a loaded 747 aircraft,
whereas the Powerhouse can lift four times that amount.
Both can easily smash through stone or bend steel.

Both archetypes are pretty tough, to

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

One player—the Gamemaster or “GM”—takes responsibility for running a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game. The Game-
master  creates  the  adventure,  runs  the  players  through  it,  takes  on  the  roles  of  the  various  other  characters  the
heroes encounter, and handles any questions about the rules as they arise. The Gamemaster also adjudicates the
process of character creation, deciding what traits, modifiers, and so forth are appropriate for the particular game,
along with the best way to express certain concepts in game terms. While Gamemastering is a big responsibility, it’s
not as hard as it might seem, and providing a fun and entertaining game for your friends can be quite rewarding.

While the players are responsible for keeping track of their characters and deciding on their actions, the Gamemaster is
responsible for everything else that happens in the game. A good GM tries to make sure the game runs as smoothly as
possible and is enjoyable for all of the players. Many components go into creating a good MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game.
The following sections give you the basics, but experience is the best tool to help you become a better Gamemaster.

can  be  broken  down  into  a  series
of tasks the heroes must perform, from piecing together
clues  about  a  villain’s  latest  scheme  to  blasting  said  vil-
lain through a wall and disarming his doomsday device in
the nick of time. It’s up to the Gamemaster to assign the
difficulty of these and numerous other tasks in the game
and to determine the outcome of the heroes’ efforts. This
section  offers  some  general  guidelines  on  assigning  the
difficulty of a task.

THE 55% RULE

tract 10 from the DC. So a DC 25 action (a formidable task)
requires a bonus of +15 in order to have a 55% chance of
success (on a roll of 10 or higher).

Keep in mind that this chance of success on a task allows
a character to automatically succeed at that task as a rou-
tine  check  (see  Routine  Checks,  following,  and  in  The
Basics chapter). This is intentional; the average character
only really fails at an average task when hurried or under
stress. A 55% chance also allows a player to spend a hero
point to automatically succeed, since a hero point ensures
a die roll of at least 11. (See Hero Points, page 20.)

A good guideline to keep in mind is the chance of an aver-
age character (with a modifier of 0) succeeding

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

ample,  Enhanced  Strength  5  increases  your  Strength  by
+5 while it is active. Your enhanced trait is still subject to
power level limits, so your unenhanced rank must be be-
low the limit by at least the amount of the enhancement
to accommodate it.

You can elongate your body and/or limbs to extend your
reach. Add your effect rank to your normal size rank to de-
termine how far you can elongate; for a normal-sized hu-
man (size rank –2) this is 15 feet at rank 1, 30 feet at rank 2,
and so forth. Rank 20 Elongation can stretch 1,000 miles!
“Snapping back” to your normal shape is a free action.

The cost of Enhanced Trait is the same per rank as acquir-
ing a rank in the affected trait. The key differences are that
Enhanced Trait is a power effect, rather than a natural trait,
and as an effect it can be combined with extra effort and
other effects. See Extra Effort in The Basics chapter and
Enhanced Abilities in the Abilities chapter for more.

You can use Elongation to make “close” attacks at a great-
er  distance  by  elongating  your  limbs.  Once  elongated,
you can make melee attacks within your new reach as a
standard action. If you can’t accurately sense your target
(you’re  elongating  around  a  corner,  for  example),  apply
the  rules  for  concealment  (see  Concealment  in  the  Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter). In addition, Elongation allows
you to wrap up and entangle an opponent so it grants a
+1 bonus to grab checks per rank (limited by PL).

ample would be a Close Burst Area Healing effect that
included the user along with everyone else in the area.
This is the equivalent of the +1 Affects Others modifier.

Ranged:  A  ranged  area  effect  can  be  placed  any-
where within the effect’s range, extending to fill the
area’s volume from the origin point.

Perception: A perception area effect can be placed
anywhere  the  user  can  accurately  perceive.  Percep-
tion area effects neither require an attack check nor
allow a Dodge resistance check, although targets still
get a normal resistance check against the effect. Per-
ception  area  effects  are  blocked  by  either  conceal-
ment or cover; choose one when acquiring the effect.
For concealment, if the attacker can’t accurately per-
ceive a target in the area, it is unaffected. Thus even
heavy smoke or darkness can block the effect. Effects
blocked by cover are much like conventional area ef-
fects:  solid  barriers  interfere  with  the  effect,  even  if
they are transparent, but the effect ignores conceal-
ment like darkness, shadows, or smoke. Only targets
behind total cover are unaffected.

Example: Mastermind has a Burst Area Affliction, al-
lowing him to seize control of the minds of everyone
in  the  affected  area.  He  must  be  able  to  accurately
perceive a target to control it; an invisible foe or one
out of his line of sight, for example, would be unaffect-
ed, even if they were within the area of the burst. On
the other hand, targets behind a glass wall or invisible
force field are affected, since Mastermind can perceive
them. Conversely, Fear-Master has a Burst Area Afflic-
tion as well—his fear-inducing gas. Targets behind a
solid barrier (such as on the other side of that glass
wall or invisible shield) are unaffected, but the unseen
or concealed target is, even though Fear-Master can’t
perceive him, since the gas still reaches them.

+0 COST PER RANK

This  extra  applies  to  personal  range  effects,  making

Teleport, causing a target to shrink or teleport away, re-
spectively.  Unlike  most  extras,  the  effect’s  cost  does  not
change, although it does work differently.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Comic books are full of storylines involving personal complications, and players are encouraged to come up with some
for their heroes. Complications have a specific use in the game as well: they give the Gamemaster a “handle” on your
hero, different challenges to introduce or include in adventures. When the GM does so, you earn hero points you can
use to enhance your character’s chances of success, amongst other things. (See Hero Points in The Basics and Action
& Adventure chapters for more information.)

Choose at least two complications for your hero: a Motiva-
tion and at least one other. You can take as many compli-
cations  as  you  wish,  although  the  GM  may  set  limits  for
the sake of being able to keep track of them all. Compli-
cations  are  also  self-limiting,  in  that  you  only  earn  hero
points  for  those  complications  that  actually  come  into
play.  So  even  if  you  have  more  than  a  dozen,  if  the  GM
can only include a couple in a game session, then those
are the ones that earn you hero points for that game. You
can—and generally should—look for opportunities to in-
clude your hero’s complications and offer suggestions to
the GM, who makes the final decision on which complica-
tions come into play at any given time.

The GM also decides what complications are appropriate
for  the  game  and  can  overrule  any  particular  complica-
tion,  based  on  the  style  and  needs  of  the  story  and  the
series.  Keep  in  mind  the  adventure  needs  to  have  room
for all of the heroes’ complications, so individual ones can
only come up so often.

Every  hero  has  something  that  drove  him  or  her  to  be-
come  a  hero  in  the  first  place—a  motivation  that  keeps
them going when things get tough. Sometimes motiva-
tion  is  the  only  difference  between  a  hero  and  a  villain.
What  made  your  hero  decide  to  fight  for  justice  rather
than turning toward more selfish goals? How does it affect
the  hero’s  methods  of  fighting  crime?  Is  there  anything
that might change or affect the hero’s motivation?

Motivation is a complication because it often determines
what a hero will do in a particular situation. The GM can
use your hero’s motivation to encourage certain actions,
and enemies may do the same. When you properly play
out your hero’s motivation, even if it isn’t necessarily the
“smartest” thing to do, the GM awards you a

This maneuver does not apply to effects requiring no at-
tack check or allowing no resistance check.

When you make an attack, you can take a penalty of up to
–2 on the effect modifier of the attack and add the same
number (up to +2) to your attack bonus. Your effect modi-

cannot more than double in this way. The changes are de-

check succeeds, your target is impaired (a –2 circumstance
penalty on checks) until the end of your next round. With
four or more degrees of success, the target is disabled (a
–5 penalty) until the end of your next round.

FEINT

You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an
opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a stan-
dard action opposed by the better of your target’s Decep-
tion or Insight. If your Deception check succeeds, the tar-
get is vulnerable against your next attack, until the end of

tion of The Basics chapter).

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

+/-2 for bonus/penalty
+/-5 for major bonus/penalty

Sometimes  characters  work  together  and  help  each  other
out. In this case, one character (usually the one with the high-
est bonus) is considered the leader of the effort and makes
the check normally, while each helper makes the same type
of check using the same trait(s) against DC 10. The helpers’ in-
dividual degrees of success (and failure!) are added together
to achieve the final outcome of the assistance.

Success grants the leader a +2 circumstance bonus. Three
or more total degrees of success grant a +5 circumstance
bonus.  One  degree  of  failure  provides  no  modifier,  but
two or more impose a –2 circumstance penalty!

The GM sets the limit on how many characters can help as
part of a team check. Regardless of the number of help-
ers, the leader’s bonus cannot be more than +5 (for three
or more total degrees of success) nor the penalty greater
than –2 (for two or more total degrees of failure).

Team Check = +2 circumstance bonus
for one total degree of success
+5 circumstance bonus for three or more total degrees of success
-2 circumstance penalty for two or more total degrees of failure

An  attack  check  determines  whether  or  not  you  hit  an
opponent  in  combat  with  an  attack.  It  is  a  d20  roll  plus
your bonus with that particular attack, usually based off
of  Fighting  or  Dexterity  and  appropriate  modifiers,  like
the Close and Ranged Combat skills. The difficulty is your
target’s  defense  class:  Parry  for  close  attacks,  Dodge  for
ranged attacks. Certain attacks may target other defenses.
If  you  equal  or  exceed  your  target’s  defense  class  result,
your attack hits. Otherwise, you miss.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus +
modifiers vs. defense class

A natural 20 on an attack check (where the die comes up
20) always hits and may be a critical hit (see Critical Hits in
the Action & Adventure chapter). A natural 1 on an attack
check (where the die comes up 1) always misses, regardless
of the check total. This differs from normal checks and re-
flects the variable and unpredictable nature of combat.

A  resistance  check  is  an  attempt  to  resist  different  ef-
fects, ranging from damage and injury to traps, poisons,
and various power effects. A resistance check is a d20 roll
+  the  appropriate  defense  (typically  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, or Will).

Resistance Check = d20 + defense bonus +
modifiers vs. hazard’s D

ous  surface  at  your  ground  speed  minus  1  rank  with  a
successful  Acrobatics  check  against  the  surface’s  DC.  A

just maintaining your balance and do not actually move,

HOOD: TIME, SPACE, AND DIMENSION TRAVEL

TRACKLESS

You leave no trail and cannot be tracked using visual sens-
es  (although  you  can  still  be  tracked  using  scent  or  other
means). You can walk across the surface of soft sand or snow
without leaving tracks and you have total concealment from
tremorsense (see Concealment, page 244). Each additional
rank renders you trackless to another sense type.
WALL-CRAWLING

You can climb walls and ceilings at your ground speed rank
–1 with no chance of falling and no need for an Athletics
check. You are still vulnerable while climbing, however. An
additional rank of this effect means you climb at your full
speed rank and are not vulnerable while climbing.
WATER-WALKING

You can stand or move at your normal ground speed on
the surface of water, quicksand, and other liquids without
sinking. If you fall prone for any reason, you sink into the
liquid normally. With 2 ranks of this effect, you can also lie
prone on a liquid surface without sinking; you only sink if
you choose to.

NULLIFY

ATTACK

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Instant • Cost: 1 point per rank

Nullify  can  counter  particular  effects  of  a  particular  de-
scriptor,  such  as  fire  effects,  magical  effects,  mental  ef-
fects, and so forth (see Countering Effects, at the start of
this chapter). You can counter one effect of your chosen
descriptor per use of Nullify. You can’t nullify innate effects
(see the Innate modifier description).

Make a ranged attack check to hit the target. Then make
an  opposed  check  of  your  Nullify  rank  and  the  targeted
effect’s  rank  or  the  target’s  Will  defense,  whichever  is
higher. If you are targeting the subject of an effect rather
than the effect’s user, make an opposed check of Nullify
rank vs. effect rank. If you win, the targeted effect turns off,
although the user can re-activate it normally. If you lose
the opposed check, you do not Nullify the effect. With two
or more degrees of failure, trying again against the same
subject in the same scene requires extra effort.
EXTRAS

Affects Insubstantial: Nullify does not require this modi-
fier to affect insubstantial targets, or the Insubstantial ef-
fect itself. You can attempt to nullify the effects of insub-
stantial targets normally.

RANGE

Each  effect  has  a  default  range,  which  may  be  changed
by modifiers.

•

•

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

You’re trained with a particular type of close attack, giv-
ing  you  a  bonus  to  your  attack  checks  with  it  equal  to
your  skill  rank  (see  Attack  Check  in  The  Basics  and  in
the  Action  &  Adventure  chapter).  Each  close  attack  is
a separate Close Combat skill with its own rank, and en-
compasses  a  single  weapon  or  power,  although  an  ar-
ray may be considered one power, at the Gamemaster’s
discretion  (see  Arrays  in  the  Powers  chapter  for  more
information).

A  successful  DC  10  Athletics  check  allows  you  to  swim
your ground speed rank minus 2 as a move action. If the
check fails, you make no progress through the water dur-
ing the action. With more than one degree of failure, you
go  under.  If  underwater,  you  must  hold  your  breath  to
avoid drowning (see page 238).

So  a  hero  might  have  Close  Combat:  Swords,  but  Close
Combat: Melee Weapons is too broad. Close Combat: Un-
armed  is  an  option,  meaning  skill  with  unarmed  strikes
like punches and kicks. However, this bonus does not ap-
ply to other forms of unarmed combat maneuvers, includ-
ing, but not limited to, grabbing or tripping.

Others with an acute sense able to detect your Commu-
nication  medium  can “tap  into”  your  transmissions  with
a Perception check (DC 10 + your Communication rank).
The eavesdropper must be within normal sensory range
of you or the receiver. With two degrees of success on the
check, the eavesdropped can also understand your trans-
missions. Effects like Concealment and Dazzle that target
your  Communication  medium  can  “jam”  or  block  your
transmissions.
EXTRAS

Area: You  can  broadcast  omni-directionally  to  every  re-
ceiver  within  your  maximum  Communication  range  at
once. Note this extra is only strictly necessary to commu-
nicate  with  everyone  over  a  wide  area  all  at  once;  since
using  and  maintaining  Communication  are  free  actions,
the GM may allow a communicator to establish and main-
tain contact with multiple discrete receivers—such as the
members  of  the  same  team—all  in  the  same  round.  +1
cost per rank.

Dimensional:  Communication  with  this  modifier  can
bridge  dimensional  barriers,  reaching  into  other  dimen-
sions and planes of existence. The Communication effect
still has its proximate range, and the GM may rule certain
subjects “out of range” of the effect, depending on their
relative positions in the other dimension. Flat +1 point.

Rapid: Your  communication  occurs  10  times  faster  than
normal speech. Each additional rank increases communi-
cation speed by a factor of 10. This is useful for high-speed
computer  links, “deep  sharing”  psychic  rapports,  and  so
forth. Flat +1 point.

Selective:  If  you  have  the  Area  extra,  you  can  choose
which receiver(s) within range get your Communication,
excluding  everyone  else.  This  allows  you  to  go  from  a
single receiver (point-to-point) to all potential receivers in
range (omni-directional) or anywhere in between. +1 cost
per rank.

Subtle:  Your  Communication  cannot  be  “overheard”  (it
is encrypted, scrambled, or otherwise protected). With 2
ranks, your Communication cannot even be detected (that
is,  no  one  can  even  tell  you  are  transmitting,  much  less
what you’re saying). Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Limited:  Communication  may  be  limited  to  only  mem-
bers of a particular group, such as a species, family, mem-
bers  of  an  organization,  and  so  forth. This  is  in  addition

TRANSFORM

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2-5 points per rank

You can change objects into other objects, altering their
shape  or  material  composition  in  the  process. You  must
touch  the  chosen  object,  which  requires  a  close  attack
check if the object is held or worn by another character.

What you can transform affects cost per rank:

•

2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one
other thing or substance, such as metal into wood,
iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.

Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands
of a cunning player. To a degree, Transform can dupli-
cate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by
transforming air into a solid material or turning oxygen
into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). This is perfectly
allowable; use the rules for other effects as guidelines
on how to handle these situations, using Transform rank
to determine resistance DCs.

Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained
duration, which may affect how such “tricks” work (e.g.,
the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffo-
cating gas dissipates unless the character concentrates
each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always,
the GM should use common sense and good judgment.

You  may  wish  to  require  characters  using  Transform
to  acquire  money  (gold,  precious  gems,  etc.)  or  other
permanent  material  goods  to  spend  power  points  on
ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain imperma-
nent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter
in your series in some way.)

It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects:
turning a steel door into water, air, or even rust certain-
ly  removes  it  as  a  barrier.  However,  keep  in  mind  that
Transform  is  normally  sustained;  the  target  isn’t  truly
destroyed unless the effect is continuous, and therefore
irreversible. Even then, the destruction of targets tends
to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of wearing-
down  and  eventually  destroying  objects,  use  Weaken
Toughness instead.

Transforming living or otherwise animate beings as op-
posed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than
Transform. To alter a target’s outward appearance only,
go  with  a  Morph  Attack  (see  the  Morph  effect).  For  a
harmful effect that does something like turn the target

Concentration:  Concentration  Move  Object  requires
more attention to maintain. You cannot concentrate to in-
crease your lifting capacity or to grab or move another ob-
ject while you are still “holding” your first. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Direction: You can only move objects in a par-
ticular direction or path, such as only up and down (to-
wards and away from the ground), only directly towards
or  away  from  you  (attraction  and  repulsion),  and  so
forth. This is useful for “gravitic” or “magnetic” versions of
the effect. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Material: You can only move a particular type of
object or material, such as only metals, plants, rock, water,
and so forth. –1 cost per rank (The GM may allow a –2 cost
per  rank  flaw  for  a  particularly  limited  type  of  material,
such as only precious metals, leaves, sand, or petroleum).

MOVEMENT

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You have a special form of movement. For each rank in this
effect, choose one of the following options:

You  can  move  instantly  from  one  dimension  to  another
as a move action. For 1 rank, you can move between your
home dimension and one other. For 2 ranks you can move
between  any  of  a  related  group  of  dimensions  (mystical
dimensions,  alien  dimensions,  etc).  For  3  ranks  you  can
travel to any dimension. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass
rank 0) of additional material with you when you move. If
you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry ad-
ditional mass up to your modifier rank.

You’re  adapted  to  a  particular  environment,  such  as  un-
derwater,  zero  gravity,  and  so  forth  (see  Environmental
Hazards,  pages  185-187,  for  details). You  suffer  none  of
the normal unfavorable circumstance or movement pen-
alties associated with that environment, moving and act-
ing normally. You are still affected by environmental haz-
ards like suffocation, exposure, and so forth. You need the
Immunity effect to ignore such things.

PERMEATE

You  can  pass  through  solid  objects  as  if  they  weren’t
there. For 1 rank, you can move at speed rank –2 through
any physical object. For 2 ranks, you can move at speed
rank –1 and for 3 ranks, you move at your normal speed
through  any  obstacles. You  cannot  breathe  while  com-
pletely  inside  a  solid  object,  so  you  either  need  Im-

LUCK

FORTUNE, RANKED (1/2 PL)

Once per round, you can choose to re-roll a die roll, like
spending a hero point (see Hero Points, page 20), includ-
ing adding 10 to re-rolls of 10 or less. You can do this a
number  of  times  per  game  session  equal  to  your  Luck
rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level
(rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero
points “reset”  at  the  start  of  an  adventure. The  GM  may
choose to set a different limit on ranks in this advantage,
depending on the series.

Generally speaking, languages are not terribly important
in comic book superhero stories except as background col-
or or occasional plot complications. Gamemasters should
allow  players  with  characters  fluent  in  other  languages
the occasional opportunity to show them off or put them
to good use. If you specifically set up the language barrier
as an obstacle by confronting the heroes with a language
they cannot possibly understand, that should count as a
complication and be worth a hero point.

COMBAT

MINION

GENERAL, RANKED

You can draw a weapon from a holster or sheath as a free
action, rather than a move action.

You have a follower or minion. This minion is an indepen-
dent  character  with  a  power  point  total  of  (advantage
rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level
limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions
(if capable of independent thought) automatically have a
helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the nor-
mal rules for minions (see page 245).

Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend
earned  power  points  to  increase  your  rank  in  this  advan-
tage to improve the minion’s power point total and traits.
Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are
replaced in between adventures with other followers with
similar abilities at the Gamemaster’s discretion.

ACTION

COMBAT

When taking a standard action and a move action you can
move both before and after your standard action, provid-
ed the total distance moved isn’t greater than your normal
movement speed.

COMBAT

When  you  make  a  power  attack  (see  Maneuvers,  page
250)  you  can  take  a  penalty  of  up  to  –5  on  your  attack
bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to the effect
bonus of your attack.

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

stow a weapon or other object, stand up, pick up an ob-
ject, or perform some equivalent action (see the Actions
in Combat Table).

You can take a move action in place of a standard action.
For example, rather than moving your speed and attack-
ing  you  can  stand  up  and  move  your  speed  (two  move
actions),  draw  a  weapon  and  climb  (two  move  actions),
or pick up an object and stow it (two move actions). You
can also make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to
run faster: one or more degree of success increases your
ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

Free actions consume very little time and, over the span of
the round, their impact is so minor they are considered to
take no real time at all. You can perform one or more free
actions  while  taking  another  action.  For  instance,  drop-
ping an object, dropping to a prone position, speaking a
sentence or two, and ceasing to concentrate on maintain-
ing a power are all free actions.

REACTION

A  reaction  is  something  that  happens  in  response  to
something  else,  like  a  reflex.  Like  free  actions,  reactions
take so little time they’re considered free. The difference
between  the  two  is  a  free  action  is  a  conscious  choice
made  on  the  character’s  turn  to  act.  A  reaction  can  oc-
cur even when it’s not your turn to act. Some powers and
other traits are usable as reactions.

NO ACTION

Finally,  some  things  players  are  called  upon  to  do—cer-
tain die rolls like resistance checks, for example—are not
considered actions at all, as they involve no action on the
part of the characters.

When  it  is  your  turn  in  the  initiative  order,  you  declare
what actions your character will perform, and they are re-
solved in order.

The Gamemaster informs you when it is your turn. When
you start your turn, you should:

•

End  effects that last “until the start of your next turn”.

You get a standard and a move action each turn. You can
exchange your standard action for an additional move ac-
tion, allowing you to perform two move actions. You can
also perform as many free actions on your turn as you wish.

You perform your actions in any order that you wish, but
you cannot normally “split” your actions. So, for example, al-

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

This section describes the various power effects available in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS. They are listed in alphabetical order.

ATTACK

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Instant • Cost: 1 point per rank

TYPE

You can impose some debilitating condition or conditions
on a target by making a close attack. You set the conditions
your  Affliction  causes  at  each  degree  when  you  acquire  it
and they may not be changed. Higher degree conditions re-
place lower degree conditions and do not stack with them.
See the possible conditions for each degree under the Af-
fliction Resistance Check table. The target resists with For-
titude or Will defense (chosen when you take the effect):

Fortitude or Will vs.
DC [Affliction rank + 10]

Success: No effect.

Failure  (one  degree):  The  target  is  dazed,  entranced,
fatigued,  hindered,  impaired,  or  vulnerable  (choose
one). Potential descriptors include coughing or sneez-
ing,  creeping  mental  influence,  drowsiness,  euphoria,
fear, itchiness, lethargy, nausea, pain, or tipsiness.

Failure (two degrees): The target is compelled, defense-
less,  disabled,  exhausted,  immobile,  prone,  or  stunned
(choose  one).  Potential  descriptors  include  agonizing
pain, confusion, ecstasy, momentary emotional or men-
tal influence, paralysis, seizure, terror, or vomiting.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  asleep,  con-
trolled,  incapacitated,  paralyzed,  transformed  or  un-
aware (choose one).

The target of an Affliction makes a resistance check at the
end of each of his turns to remove first and second degree
conditions. Third  degree  conditions  require  a  minute  of
recovery time or outside aid, such as the Treatment skill or
Healing effect (DC 10 + rank).

The exact nature and descriptors of the Affliction are up
to you, chosen when you acquire the effect, with the GM’s
approval;  some  examples  are  provided,  but  feel  free  to
make up your own.

Perception range effects must accurately perceive a target in order to affect it. This generally means you cannot target
subjects with total concealment from your accurate senses with perception range effects. Thus, foes with Visual Conceal-
ment (the most common accurate sense) can be quite effective against characters relying on perception range attacks,
unless the attacker has an unusual accurate sense to circumvent the Concealment. This is one reason Visual Concealment
costs extra.

At the Gamemaster’s discretion, a successful Perception check to accurately locate a target with an acute sense may al-
low you to use perception range effects on that target; however, the target still benefits from concealment, granting a +5
circumstance bonus to resistance against the effect.

ranks. A plant’s sense of its surroundings is limited, so it
won’t be able to give (or recognize) detailed descriptions
or answer questions about events outside its immediate
vicinity.

SPIRITS

You can communicate with incorporeal and normally in-
visible and inaudible spirit beings, such as ghosts or cer-
tain extradimensional entities, depending on the context
of the setting. Rank 1 essentially allows you to function as
a “medium” of sorts, able to perceive spirits and relay what
you see and hear. Rank 2 allows you to be clearly under-
stood by denizens of the spirit world, as well. At the GM’s
discretion,  this  effect  may  extend  to  undead  creatures,
demons, or other supernatural entities, depending on the
setting.

FLAWS

Type: You can only comprehend a broad type of subject
(only elves, canines, avians, or sea creatures, for example).
For an additional flaw, you can only comprehend a narrow
type of subject (dogs, falcons, or dolphins, for example).
Broad –1 cost per rank. Narrow –2 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You gain total concealment from a particular sense while
this  effect  is  active,  although  you  are  still  detectable  to
other senses (even other senses of the same sense type;
so you could have full concealment against normal sight,
but not infravision or any other sense in the sight sense
type).  Each  additional  rank  gives  you  concealment  from
another sense; two ranks give you concealment for an en-
tire sense type. See Concealment on page 244 for the full
effects.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Powers  based  off  the Variable  effect  are  obviously  very  flexible,  capable  of  duplicating  a  wide  range  of  other  effects.
Responsibility for controlling Variable effects in the game is placed largely in the hands of both the Gamemaster and
responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with numerous game-system limitations
that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of effects.

Keep in mind a Variable effect is not supposed to be “any effect I want.” That kind of unlimited power doesn’t belong in the
hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A Variable effect can be “any effect within a
given set of parameters,” but it’s up to you and the GM to define those parameters. The limits of power flexibility in MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS are deliberately set by Variable effects, the use of extra effort, and hero points.

Many  comic  book  heroes  who  appear  to  have  the  power  to “do  anything”  are  actually  using  one  of  these  options  in
terms.  For  example,  a  super-wizard  can  do  practically  anything  with  magic.  However,  generally
speaking, these characters have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with power points) and
“stunts” they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly hero points).
This is why the Magic power given later in this chapter, for example, is not a Variable effect: most powers in the game
have the potential to do “stunts” via extra effort, so the “variability” of Magic seen in the comics is already built-in to the
system, with some costs to control it, without having to give players carte blanche to duplicate any effect in the game at
will (which is just likely to slow things down and cause game balance issues).

Variable effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and define everything about a given power in
advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an application of the Morph effect with a long
list of Metamorph options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at a time, would be tedious to say the
least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A Variable effect, with the descriptor “animal
forms” is easier to manage. The player can pre-build certain commonly used animal forms for use during play, but also ha

Insight  check.  Senses  with  the  Counters  Illusion  effect
(see Senses) automatically detect illusions. If any viewer
successfully uncovers an illusion and communicates this
fact to others, they gain another Insight check with a +5
circumstance bonus. Circumstances may grant additional
modifiers to the Insight check to uncover an illusion, de-
pending on how convincing it is.

Maintaining an active illusion (such as a fighting creature)
requires a standard action each round, but maintaining a
static illusion (one that doesn’t move or interact) is only a
free action.

EXTRAS

Illusion is a broad-ranging effect, usable for a number of
different things. A few common considerations for Illu-
sion include the following.

Independent: Your active illusions only require a free action
to maintain, rather than a standard action. +1 cost per rank.

Selective:  You  choose  who  perceives  your  Illusion  and
who doesn’t. +1 cost per rank.

For illusions so realistic they are capable of inflicting dam-
age, add a Linked Perception Range Damage effect. At the
GM’s discretion, this effect can even be made into a Linked
Array  with  a  variety  of  alternate  attack  effects,  allowing
your illusionist to inflict conditions other than damage on
targets. Keep in mind the attack effects all need to be per-
ception range to match the range of Illusion.

Illusion  can  alter  a  subject’s  appearance,  providing  an
essentially impenetrable disguise—at least until some-
one  makes  a  successful  check  to  see  through  the  illu-
sion.  However,  for  just  the  ability  to  alter  appearance,
use the Morph effect, which is generally more effective
than Illusion Limited to Appearance.

The  default  Illusion  effect  is  perceptible  to  anyone  or
anything  (including  machines)  as  if  it  were  real.  Some
illusions exist solely in the mind, like projected psychic
hallucinations. This type of Illusion has the Resistible by
Will flaw and the Selective extra, since the illusionist can
choose whether or not to project the illusion into a par-
ticular subject’s mind, and therefore decides who can or
cannot perceive the illusion. This is a net +0 modifier, for
the same base cost.
MY ALLY, MY ENEMY

A common Illusion trick is to switch the appearances of
an  enemy  and  an  ally,  causing  a  foe’s  teammate  to  at-
tack  that  enemy  by  mistake. You  can  generally  handle
this with an opposed check of Illusion and Insight; if you

You  can  make  grab  attacks  with  only  one  arm,  leaving
the other free. You can also maintain the grab while using
your other hand to perform actions. You are not vulner-
able while grabbing (see Grabbing in the Action & Ad-

COMBAT

Your grab attacks are particularly difficult to escape. Op-
ponents  you  grab  suffer  a  –5  circumstance  penalty  on
checks to escape.

COMBAT, RANKED

You have a +4 bonus to your initiative checks per rank in
this advantage.

COMBAT

You have no penalty to attack checks to hit an object held
by another character (see Smash in the Action & Adven-
ture chapter).

You  have  no  penalty  to  your  attack  check  to  trip  an  op-
ponent and they do not get the opportunity to trip you.
When  making  a  trip  attack,  make  an  opposed  check  of
your Acrobatics or Athletics against your opponent’s Ac-

robatics  or  Athletics,  you  choose  which  your  opponent
uses to defend, rather than the target choosing (see Trip
in the Action & Adventure chapter). This is a good martial
arts advantage for unarmed fighters.

SKILL

You ignore the circumstance penalty for using skills with-
out proper tools, since you can improvise sufficient tools
with whatever is at hand. If you’re forced to work without
tools at all, you suffer only a –2 penalty.

COMBAT, RANKED

When  wielding  an  improvised  close  combat  weapon—
anything from a chair to a telephone pole or entire car—
you use your Close Combat: Unarmed skill bonus for at-
tack checks with the “weapon” rather than relying on your

vised weapons per rank. Your maximum Damage bonus is
still limited by power level, as usual.

own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

Kung Fu: Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Improved Smash, Improved Trip, Instant Up, Power Attack,
Startle.

Sword-fighting: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Taunt.

•  Wrestling: Chokehold, Fast Grab, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Power Attack.

Comic book martial artists often have abilities far beyond the scope of the advantages and fighting styles given in this
chapter. Such superhuman martial arts abilities as leaping vast distances, punching through solid stone, shrugging off
damage, and killing with a mere touch are powers. See the Powers chapter for details.

bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to both your
active defenses (Dodge and Parry).

COMBAT, RANKED

You can avoid damage through agility and “rolling” with
an  attack. You  receive  a  bonus  to  your Toughness  equal
to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active de-
fense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in
the  Abilities  chapter),  so  you  lose  this  bonus  whenever
you  are  vulnerable  or  defenseless. Your  total Toughness,
including this advantage, is still limited by power level.

This advantage is common for heroes who lack either su-
perhuman speed or toughness, rely

applies to when you acquire it and the GM must approve
it. You can take Ultimate Effort multiple times, each time,
it  applies  to  a  different  check. This  advantage  may  not
be  used  after  you’ve  rolled  the  die  to  determine  if  you
succeed.

The following are some potential Ultimate Efforts. The GM
is free to add others suitable to the series.

•

•

•

Ultimate Aim: When  you  take  a  standard  action  to
aim an attack (see Aim, page 246), you can spend a
hero point to apply a 20 result to the attack check on
the following round. Since the Ultimate Aim bonus is
not a natural 20, it also does not qualify as an auto-
matic or critical hit.

Ultimate Resistance: You can spend a hero point to
apply a 20 result to a resistance check with one de-
fense determined when you acquire this advantage.

Ultimate Skill: You can spend a hero point to apply a
20 result to checks with a particular skill.

COMBAT

You are especially attuned to danger. You are not vulnera-
ble when surprised or otherwise caught off-guard. You are
still made vulnerable by effects that limit your mobility.

COMBAT

If you take the defend action (see Defend in the Action
&  Adventure  chapter)  and  successfully  defend  against
a  close  weapon  attack,  you  can  make  a  disarm  attempt
against the attacker immediately as a reaction. The disarm
attempt  is  carried  out  normally,  including  the  attacker
getting the opportunity to disarm you.

COMBAT

If you take the defend action (see Defend in the Action
&  Adventure  chapter)  and  successfully  defend  against
a close weapon attack, you can make an attack against
the attacker’s weapon immediately as a reaction. This re-
quires an attack check and inflicts normal damage to the
weapon if it hits (see Smash in the Action & Adventure
chapter).

WELL-INFORMED

SKILL

You are exceptionally well-informed. When encountering
an individual, group, or organization for the first time, you
can make an immediate Investigation or Persuasion skill
check to see if your character has heard something about
the subject. Use the guidelines for gathering information
in the Investigation skill description to determine the lev-
el of information you gain. You receive only one check per
subject  upon  first  encountering  them,  although  the  GM
may allow another upon encountering the subject again
once significant time has passed.

though you can move (move action) and then attack (stan-
dard  action)  or  attack  and  then  move,  you  cannot  move
half  your  distance,  attack,  and  then  move  the  other  half
unless you have some special trait that allows you to do so.

At the end of your turn, you should:

•

End any effects that last “until the end of your turn”.

•  Make  any  necessary  resistance  checks  to  recover

You  can  use  extra  effort  in  order  to  take  an  additional

from ongoing effects.

Inform the Gamemaster and other players that your
turn is finished, allowing the next character in the ini-
tiative order to go.

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game terms, a challenge is an action or series of actions where players are called upon to make
checks of their characters’ traits, but which do not involve direct conflict, such as fighting. Some challenges are quick
and involve only a single character, such as a hero making a daring leap or acrobatic maneuver, while others are more
involved and require the efforts of a whole team, such as clearing all of the people out of a burning building or search-
ing the entire city (or world!) for an escaped criminal.

The challenges given in this section are by no means the only possible ones. They simply cover the major “building
blocks” Gamemasters can use to create challenges in their own games and offer examples. Feel free to come up with
your own challenges to test the heroes’ abilities and give the players an opportunity to come up with clever plans of
their own.

Challenges may or may not involve initiative checks, de-
pending on the nature of the challenge.

If all of the characters get a turn and it does not particu-
larly matter who goes first, then the Gamemaster can dis-
pense with initiative for the challenge. For example, if the
heroes  all  have  to  leap  across  a  chasm,  then  it  is  a  chal-
lenge they must all complete, and it does not particularly
matter which of them goes first or last in doing so (since
their actions are all virtually simultaneous).

With other challenges, it does matter who goes first, par-
ticular when the challenge is timed in some fashion. So,
for example, if the GM determines that part of a burning
building will collapse after the first round, initiative may
be  checked  to  see  which  heroes  go  before  the  collapse

means your attack hits automatically, since the target has
no defense bonus, and the routine check overcomes the
normal difficulty.

If  you  choose  to  make  your  attack  check  normally
(against DC 10), then a successful hit is treated as a criti-
cal hit, with a +5 circumstance bonus to the attack’s re-
sistance DC. Additionally, if you hit with a damaging at-
tack with intent to kill, and the target’s resistance check
has three or more degrees of failure, the target dies im-
mediately.

When you make an attack you can take a penalty of up to
–2 on your attack bonus and add the same number (up to
+2) to the effect bonus of your attack. Your attack bonus
cannot  be  reduced  below  +0  and  the  effect  bonus  can-
not more than double. The changes to attack and effect
are  decided  before you  make  your  attack  check  and  last
until the start of your next turn. This maneuver does not
apply to effects requiring no attack check or allowing no
resistance check.

When you charge, you can charge right into your target,
using  your  momentum  to  strengthen  your  attack,  but
potentially receiving some damage from the impact your-
self. The damage rank for your attack equals your move-

ment  speed  rank,  or  your  normal  damage  rank,  with  a
+1 circumstance bonus, whichever is higher. If you move
your full speed before you charge, increase your damage
by either means by an additional +1 circumstance bonus.
The Gamemaster may limit your base slam attack damage
(before  applying  circumstance  modifiers)  by  the  series
power level.

Example:  Slingshot  flies  into  a  foe,  moving  at
speed  rank  10.  His  unarmed  damage  (Strength)
rank is only 2, so he uses his speed rank of 10 for the
damage. Since he also moved his full speed to build
up momentum, he increases his damage by +1 for
a total damage rank of 11. If a base damage rank
of 10 is too high for the series, the GM may impose
a  lower  limit  on  Slingshot’s  slam  attack  damage,
applying the +1 modifier for the full speed move to
the lowered rank.

You suffer some of the impact of slamming into a target;
make a Toughness resistance check against half the dam-
age rank of your attack (rounded down).

Example: Slingshot hits his target, and must make
his own Toughness resistance check against dam-
age rank 5: his slam attack damage of 11, divided
by 2, which equals 5.5, rounded down to 5. Fortu-
nately,  Slingshot’s  helmet  provides  him  with  an

the  round  in  which  the  duration  ends.  So,  for  example,
an instant duration Affliction only lasts one round, while
a  sustained  duration  Affliction  lasts  until  no  longer  sus-
tained. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Degree: Your Affliction is limited to no more than
two degrees of effect. With two applications of this modi-
fier, it is limited to no more than one degree of effect. –1
cost per rank.

BURROWING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel be-
hind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a
speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Bur-
rowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground
at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard
clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank.
Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional
ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or
collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you
begin burrowing each new tunnel).

Note  that  Burrowing  differs  from  the  Permeate  effect  of
Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle
like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing
it at all (see Movement for details).
EXTRAS

Penetrating:  Normally,  the  hardness  of  the  ground  af-
fects  only  the  speed  at  which  you  burrow.  At  the  GM’s
discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered
Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows
you to dig through them. 1 point per rank.

Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a
greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of
the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Oth-
ers, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone
else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of
the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Limited:  Burrowing  may  be  limited  to  certain  circum-
stances  or  materials,  such  as  only  loose  sand  and  soil

BLAST

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You  can  make  a  damaging  ranged  attack.  It  might  be
a  blast  of  energy,  a  projectile  (arrow,  bullet,  throwing
blade, etc.), or some similar effect. You make a ranged
attack  check  against  the  target’s  Dodge  defense.  The
attack’s damage equals your power rank and the target
makes a Toughness resistance check against it.

EXTRAS

Area: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets
in the affected area. You spend only one hero point, but
the subjects are each affected individually. You must ap-
ply the same effect to all subjects at once. +1 cost per rank.

Luck: Each rank in this extra gives you the benefit of a rank
in the Luck advantage (see Luck in the Advantages chap-
ter). It is subject to the same limits as the Luck advantage
set by the GM. Flat +1 point per rank of Luck.

Selective: This extra, applied to Area Luck Control, allows
you to choose who in the area is or is not affected by it. +1
cost per rank.

FLAWS

Action: If the action required for Luck Control is increased
beyond a reaction, it is only usable during your turn each

Effect:  Perception  Ranged  Damage,  Resisted  by  Will  •
4 points per rank

You can strike targets’ minds with “mental force,” inflict-
ing  Damage  resisted  by  the  target’s  Will  rather  than
Toughness, but having no effect on targets immune to
effects resisted by Will, such as inanimate objects. Men-
tal Blasts are often, but not always, Subtle as well, which
costs a flat 1 point.

MAGIC

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You are a sorcerer, witch, or wizard, able to cast a variety
of magical spells. Your basic default effect is a Blast of
eldritch  force,  able  to  inflict  Ranged  Damage  (see  the
Blast power, previously).

However,  like  the  Energy  Control  power,  Magic  can
have a wide range of Alternate Effects, each a separate
spell you have mastered. The possibilities are virtually
limitless, within the bounds of your hero’s descriptors
and  the  Gamemaster’s  approval.  Examples  include
mystic  bindings  (Affliction,  see  the  Snare  version),
dispelling  magical  effects  (Nullify  Magic),  conjuring
clouds of mist or fog (an Area Visual Concealment At-
tack), scrying distant places (Remote Sensing), or slip-
ping  between  the  dimensions  to  appear  elsewhere
(Teleport), to name just a few.

All Magic effects have the “magic” descriptor regardless
of their other descriptors, so a Blast of flames conjured
with magic has both the “magic” and “fire” descriptors,
for example.

Magicians  often  have  a  Power  Loss  complication  (see
Complications  in  The  Basics  chapter):  if  they  are  un-
able to freely speak and gesture to cast their spells, they
cannot  use  Magic  (or  any  related  magical  powers  reli-
ant on spellcasting). Certain styles of Magic may impose

suffer any damage from landing after a jump, so long as it
is within your maximum distance.

Continuous:  Extending  the  effect’s  duration  to  continu-
ous allows you to remain Insubstantial until you choose to
return to your corporeal form. +1 cost per rank.

Innate: Use this modifier if your character’s form is natu-
rally  or  innately  Insubstantial,  particularly  if  the  effect  is
permanent in duration. Flat +1 point.

Precise: This modifier allows you to selectively make some
portions of your body insubstantial while keeping others
substantial (or vice versa). This allows you to do things like
reach through a wall, solidify your hand to pick up an ob-
ject  or  tap  someone  on  the  shoulder  (or  punch  them  in
the face), and become incorporeal again to withdraw it on
the following round. Flat +1 point.

Progressive:  You  can  assume  lower  ranked  forms  of  In-
substantial, but you must progress through them in order
to reach the higher-ranked ones. For example if you have
Progressive Insubstantial 3, you can assume fluid, gaseous,
or energy forms, but to assume energy form, you must first
progress through fluid and gaseous, becoming less and less
substantial. Since you can only activate the effect once per
turn, it takes you three turns to get there. +0 cost per rank.

Reaction: Becoming Insubstantial is normally a free action,
meaning  you  can’t  switch  to  an  Insubstantial  form  when
surprised or otherwise unable to take action. At the GM’s
option, applying the Action extra to use Insubstantial as a
reaction allows you to switch forms “reflexively” in response
to such hazards, even if it is not your turn. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle:  This  extra  makes  your  Insubstantial  nature  less
noticeable  to  observers.  Rank  1  requires  a  Perception
check (DC 20) to detect that you are Insubstantial, while 2
ranks mean you look entirely normal in Insubstantial form
(which may cause opponents to waste effort on you, not
knowing  you  are  immune  to  their  attacks,  for  example).
Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Absent Strength: This flaw applies only to rank 1 Insub-
stantial and removes your effective Strength while in that
form, leaving you with limited ability to affect the physical
world like the higher ranks of the effect. Flat –1 point.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

The  exception  is  Toughness,  which  can  only  be  increased
above your base Stamina rank using advantages and pow-
ers, not by direct spending of power points. This reflects that
greater-than-normal Toughness is virtually always some sort
of special ability. See the Advantages and Powers chapters
for various options for improving Toughness, notably the De-
fensive Roll advantage and the Protection effect.

Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to
be fully effective. Limits on your mobility, focus, and reac-
tion time adversely affect them. If you are vulnerable, your
Dodge  and  Parry  defense  ranks  are  halved  (divide  their
normal values by 2 and round up), and if you are defense-
less, they are both reduced to 0!

One  use  of  defenses  is  determining  a  defense  class,  or
the  difficulty  class  to  affect  a  target  with  a  particular  at-
tack. This  is  the  appropriate  defense,  plus  10,  just  like  a
routine  check  (indeed,  it  is  essentially  a  measure  of  the
character’s “routine” defense). So hitting a character with
a ranged attack goes against Dodge defense, giving the
attack a DC of (Dodge + 10). Similarly, affecting someone
with a mental power goes against Will defense, with a DC
of (Will + 10), and so forth. This is referred to as “targeting”
a defense, such as “targets Dodge” or “targets Will”.

The main defense class traits are Dodge, Parry, and Will.

Defenses  are  also  used  to  measure  the  ability  to  over-
come certain effects, involving a resistance check of the
defense plus a die roll against a difficulty class determined
by the effect or hazard. So you might make a Fortitude re-
sistance check for your hero to overcome a toxin, for ex-
ample, or a Dodge resistance check to avoid a trap just as
it is triggered, and so on. This is referred to as “resisting,”
such as “resisted by Fortitude” or “resisted by Dodge”.

The  main  resistance  check  traits  are  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, and Will.

When  things  start  happening  quickly,  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
characters use their initiative bonuses to determine
who goes first. Each character involved in a conflict makes
a check of d20 + initiative modifier, which is:

Initiative Modifier = Agility + Advantages
(Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers

Characters then act in initiative order, from highest to low-
est. For details see the Action & Adventure chapter.

use  perception  ranged  effects  via  your  Remote  Sensing.
Despite the built-in limitation, this is an extra, since it al-
lows you to use your Remote Sensing to observe subjects
in relative safety. +1 cost per rank.

Simultaneous:  You  can  use  both  Remote  Sensing  and
your normal senses at the same time, perceiving two lo-
cales like “translucent” overlays of each other. This means
you’re more capable of taking physical action while also
using  your  Remote  Sensing,  although  the  effect  still  re-
quires its normal duration to maintain. You are not vulner-
able while using your Remote Sensing. +1 cost per rank.

Subtle: Remote Sensing already has a degree of subtlety. Ap-
plying 1 rank of Subtle to Remote Sensing increases the DC
to notice the effect to 20 + rank or makes it noticeable only to
a particular unusual sense (with the usual DC 10 + rank per-
ception check). Subtle 2 makes Remote Sensing completely
unnoticeable, as usual. Flat +1 point per rank of Subtle.
FLAWS

Feedback:  With  this  flaw,  damaging  attacks  directed  at
where you displaced your senses can affect you. Your sen-
sory-point is considered to have partial cover from attacks
and you use your Remote Sensing rank as your Toughness
defense against any successful attack. The feedback may
be psychosomatic in nature or due to some sort of disrup-
tion  caused  by  an  assault  on  the  point  where  you  have
redirected your senses. Note that sensory effects already
work on you via Remote Sensing and this flaw doesn’t ap-
ply to them. –1 cost per rank.

Medium: You  require  a  medium  for  your  Remote  Sens-
ing, such as shadows, flames, mirrors, open water, televi-
sion screens, and so forth. You can only perceive locations
where your chosen medium exists. –1 cost per rank.

Noticeable: Remote Sensing with this flaw has an easily
noticeable display, like a glowing set of eyes or a phantom
image of your face, head, or body at the location you are
observing. This manifestation cannot be used for commu-
nication, however (for that, take the Communication ef-
fect). Flat –1 point.

Sense-Dependent:  Remote  Sensing  is  already  Sense-
Dependent  and  cannot  apply  this  flaw.  Another  effect
might potentially have the flaw Remote-Sensing Depen-
dent, such as an Affliction that targets only remote view-
ers observing a target or an area as a means of blocking or
deterring them.

Some  checks  are  opposed.  They  are  made  against  an-
other character’s check result as the DC. Whoever gets the
higher result wins. An example is trying to bluff someone.
You roll a Deception check, while the GM rolls an Insight
check for your target. If you beat the target’s Insight check
result, you succeed.

For ties on opposed checks, the character with the higher
bonus  wins.  If  the  bonuses  are  the  same,  roll  d20.  On  a
1–10, one character wins, and on an 11–20, victory goes to
the other character; decide which character is “high” and
which is “low” before rolling.

Opposed checks offer the Gamemaster a useful tool for
comparing the efforts of two characters quickly and eas-
ily. This applies not only to skills, but also powers and, in
some cases, abilities. If two or more characters compete
at a particular task, you can resolve it with an opposed

Of  course,  you  can  play  things  out  if  you  want,  but
sometimes it’s good to be able to resolve things with a
quick opposed check and move on.

As Gamemaster, if you find yourself without a particular
rule to resolve a conflict or contest between characters,
the opposed check is your friend. Pick the appropriate
skill,  power,  or  ability,  make  checks  for  the  characters
and compare the results to see how they did.

Active defenses in combat, where characters are focusing

propriate defense. Active opposed checks in combat are
an  option  when  a  character  goes  on  the  defensive.  See

Subtle:  As  a  mental  sensory  effect,  Mind  Reading  has  a
degree  of  subtlety,  only  noticeable  to  the  subject  or  to
characters  with  an  appropriate  mental  sense,  such  as
Mental  Awareness  (see  the  Senses  effect).  Subtle  Mind
Reading is less detectable, requiring a DC 20 Perception
check  for  either  type  of  character  to  sense  it,  while  two
ranks  of  the  Subtle  modifier  makes  your  Mind  Reading
completely undetectable. Flat +1 or 2 points.

FLAWS

Close: Applied to Ranged Mind Reading, Close Mind Read-
ing requires a close attack check to touch an unwilling tar-
get and physical contact throughout the effect’s duration;
breaking contact ends the effect. –1 cost per rank.

Feedback: You suffer Feedback if a subject you are reading
is harmed, using your Mind Reading rank as the resistance
check  bonus  against  the  damage.  Additionally,  you  may
suffer Feedback at the GM’s discretion from reading or ex-
periencing  particularly  traumatic  or  emotionally-charged
thoughts of memories from the subject. –1 cost per rank.

Limited by Language: You can only understand the sub-
ject’s thoughts or memories if you share a common lan-
guage. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Emotions: You can only read or probe for emo-
tions and emotional associations, not coherent thoughts
or memories. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Sensory Link: If you have the Sensory Link extra
and this flaw, you can only tap into a subject’s senses, you
cannot read their thoughts or memories. –1 cost per rank.

Limited to Surface Thoughts: You can only read surface
thoughts and cannot achieve higher degrees of contact.
–1 cost per rank.

Ranged: Ranged Mind Reading requires a ranged attack
check in addition to the effect’s normal resistance check.
–1 cost per rank.

Sense-Dependent: Your Mind Reading is dependent on
a  sense  other  than  just  having  to  accurately  sense  the
target, such as needing to see his expressions (Sight-De-
pendent), hear him speak (Hearing-Dependent), smell his
changes in biochemistry (Scent-Dependent), and so forth.
Alternately, it may be dependent on first being in Mental
Communication with the target (see Communication). –1

Insulating Fur: You have a layer of fur that protects
you from intense heat and cold, giving you immunity
to those environments.

Internal Compartment: You can carry a portion of
your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a
pouch  or  compartment  of  some  sort,  able  to  hold
objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than
your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).

Iron  Stomach: You  can  eat  anything  that’s  not  toxic
without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be:
spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.

•  Mimicry: You can imitate almost any sound you’ve
heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks
to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.

The  Feature  effect  is  intended  to  round  out  various
minor traits and abilities characters might have, but it
is entirely optional and not meant to burden MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS character design with needless amounts
of detail. It’s for traits with an actual game effect, not
merely  descriptors  or  background  color  (neither  of
which should cost any points). Ultimately, the Game-
master  decides  what  traits  merit  a  rank  (or  more)  of
Feature and what Features are permitted for any given
game or setting, using the examples given here.

If  a  “feature”  is  something  likely  to  come  up  only
occasionally, or even just once, then you are better
off  allowing  it  as  an  aspect  of  the  inspiration  and
power  stunt  rules  (see  the  Characteristics  chap-
ter), charging the player a hero point for the feature
when it comes into play. The player can then choose
whether  or  not  to  use  earned  power  points  to  ac-
quire the Feature as a regular part of the character’s
traits later on.

gust of wind at the right dramatic moment, or ideal
spotlighting, or personal theme music. The GM may
give  you  a  +2  bonus  for  favorable  circumstances
when your special effect is likely to impress people or
otherwise aid you.

ing  Damage  resisted  by  Fortitude.  At  the  GM’s  discre-
tion,  radiation  exposure  can  lead  to  other  effects,  such
as damage to a hero’s power ranks (causing a temporary
decrease in powers).
VACUUM

The primary hazards of the vacuum of space are lack of air
and exposure to unfiltered ionizing radiation.

On  the  third  round  of  exposure  to  vacuum,  a  character
must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  20)  each  round
or suffer from aeroembolism (“the bends”). A failed check
means excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in the
creature’s  bloodstream;  the  creature  is  stunned  and  re-
mains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure.
Two or more degrees of failure impose the incapacitated
condition.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though
holding one’s breath in vacuum damages the lungs. A char-
acter who attempts to hold his breath must make a Forti-
tude check (DC 15) every round; the DC increases by 1 each
round, and on a successful check the character loses a rank
of Stamina (from the pressure on the linings of his lungs). If
the check fails, or when the character simply stops holding
his breath, he begins to suffocate: the next round, he be-
comes incapacitated . The following round, he’s dying and
cannot stabilize until returned to a normal atmosphere.

Unfiltered  radiation  bombards  any  character  trapped  in
the vacuum of space without protective gear, see Radia-
tion, previously.

Heroes able to ignore the effects of deep space must have
Immunity to suffocation, vacuum, and radiation, at a mini-
mum. See the Immunity effect in the Powers chapter for
details.

CONFLICTS

A conflict is when two or more characters go up against each other, typically in a fight of some sort. Conflict between
heroes and villains is a prime part of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS and a big element of the fun, just like the colorful and spec-
tacular fights in the superhero comic books.

ATTACKS

An attack check represents an attempt to hit a target with
an attack. When you make an attack check, roll the die and
add your bonus with that attack. If your result equals or
exceeds  the  target’s  defense,  your  attack  hits  and  may
have some effect.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus vs.
defense class

When you make an attack check and get a natural 20 (the
d20 actually shows 20), you automatically hit, regardless
of  your  target’s  defense,  and  you  score  a  threat. The  hit

hand” for talking about a group of basic conditions that
go together in a particular circumstance, much like a pow-
er is a collection of basic effects.

The individual conditions making up a combined condi-
tion can be resolved individually. For example, if an effect
that removes the dazed condition is used on a staggered
character (who is dazed and hindered), then the character
is no longer dazed, only hindered. Similarly, if an effect im-
poses a condition that supersedes part of the combined
condition, only that part changes. So an effect that stuns a
staggered character means the character is now stunned
(superseding  dazed)  and  hindered.  Similarly,  an  effect
that immobilizes a staggered character leaves the target
dazed and immobile (superseding the hindered element
of the combined condition).

•

Asleep:  While  asleep,  a  character  is  defenseless,
stunned,  and  unaware.  A  hearing  Perception  check
with  three  or  more  degrees  of  success  wakes  the
character and removes all these conditions, as does
any sudden movement (such as shaking the sleeping
character) or any effect allowing a resistance check.

Blind:  The  character  cannot  see.  Everything  ef-
fectively  has  full  visual  concealment  from  him.  He
is  hindered,  visually  unaware,  and  vulnerable,  and
may be impaired or disabled for activities where vi-
sion is a factor.

Bound: A bound character is defenseless, immobile,
and impaired.

Deaf: The  character  cannot  hear,  giving  everything
total  auditory  concealment  from  him.  This  may  al-
low  for  surprise  attacks  on  the  unaware  character
(see  Surprise  Attack  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). Interaction with other characters is limited
to  sign-language  and  lip-reading  (see  Interaction
Skills in Chapter 3).

Dying: A dying character is incapacitated (defense-
less, stunned, and unaware) and near death. When
the  character  gains  this  condition,  immediately
make  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  15).  If  the  check  suc-
ceeds,  nothing  happens. With  two  degrees  of  suc-
cess,  the  character  stabilizes,  removing  this  condi-
tion. If the check fails, the character remains dying.
Three  or  more  total  degrees  of  failure  mean  the
character  dies:  so  three  failed  Fortitude  checks  or
one or two checks adding up to three degrees. Dy-
ing  characters  make  a  Fortitude  check  each  round

DAMAGE

A successful attack with a Damage effect requires the tar-
get to make a Toughness resistance check.

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage,  the  target’s  condition  shifts  to  dying.  A  dying
target  who  fails  a  resistance  check  against  Damage  is
dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability
to hit things! You can apply effect modifiers to the Dam-
age your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even
an  Area  effect!  You  can  also  have  Alternate  Effects  for
your Strength Damage; see the Alternate Effect modi-
fier  for  details.  Like  other  Damage  effects,  a  character’s
Strength Damage is close range and instant duration by
default.

If you choose, a Damage effect can be Strength-based—
something like a melee weapon—allowing your Strength
Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and Damage
ranks together when determining the rank of the attack.
Any modifiers applied to your Damage must also apply to
your Strength rank if its bonus damage is to benefit from
them.  However,  any  decrease  in  your  Strength  reduces
the amount you can add to your Damage, and negative
Strength  subtracts  from  your  Damage!  Likewise,  any-
thing that prevents you from exerting your Strength also
stops you from using a Strength-based Damage effect. If
you can’t swing your fist, you can’t swing a sword, either.

You can inflict damage on a target by making a close at-

the GM’s approval; it can be anything from a powerful im-

medium. The target resists with Toughness:

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage, the target’s condition shifts to dying. A dying tar-
get who fails a resistance check against Damage is dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability

less than ideal conditions. This section details some of the
hazards heroes may face.

FALLING

Criminals  often  lurk  in  the  darkness,  and  many  crimes
take  place  at  night.  Most  cities  are  lit  well  enough,  but
sometimes  heroes  run  into  areas  where  it’s  difficult  to
see. Poorly lit areas provide concealment. Characters with
Counters Concealment (Darkness) Senses or other appro-
priate Senses effects can ignore concealment penalties for
poor lighting.

Intense  heat  and  cold  wear  down  characters,  while  pro-
longed exposure to the elements can be extremely dan-
gerous.

Characters in hot or cold conditions must make Fortitude
checks (DC 10, +1 per previous check) to avoid becoming
fatigued.  Fatigued  characters  who  fail  a  check  become
exhausted, then incapacitated, at which point the charac-
ter’s condition becomes dying after another failed Forti-
tude check.

How  often  characters  have  to  make  Fortitude  checks  de-
pends on the conditions. Once an hour for uncomfortable
heat or cold (a hot summer day or cold winter day), once
per 10 minutes for intense heat or cold (a blazing desert or
arctic conditions), once a minute for extreme heat or cold
like the edge of a volcano or an arctic winter storm. Checks
are made at the end of each period of exposure. Truly in-
tense heat or cold—such as a blast furnace or touching liq-
uid nitrogen—inflicts direct damage like an attack.

Characters with the appropriate Immunity do not need to
make Fortitude checks for extreme temperatures.

Heroes  can  go  without  water  for  a  day.  After  this,  they
need to make a Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous
check) each hour to avoid a level of fatigue. Heroes can go
without food for three days. After this, they must make a
Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each day
to  avoid  fatigue.  The  character  cannot  recover  until  he
gets  water  or  food.  Heroes  with  Immunity  to  Starvation
can go an unlimited time without food or water.

Characters can hold their breath for ten rounds (one min-
ute) plus a number of rounds equal to twice their Stamina.
After that time they must make a Fortitude check (DC 10)
each round to continue holding their breath. The DC in-
creases  by  +1  for  each  previous  success.  Failure  on  the
Fortitude  check  means  the  character  becomes  incapaci-
tated . On the following round the character is dying. A dy-
ing character cannot stabilize until

The GM rolls attack checks against the heroes. Two smugglers shoot at Ultramarine and three shoot at Princess, but they both
have Impervious Toughness 8. Since the smugglers’ guns can’t hurt them, the GM does not bother rolling the attack checks. The
remaining two shoot at Rook, but one is impaired and the other blind, so they both miss by a mile.

Rook, you easily avoid the clumsy shots, especially from the guys dazzled by the flash bomb. Princess, Ultramarine, a

or 32. No way the smuggler can succeed.

Wow! You send the guy flying right off the deck and into the drink! Sploosh!

Then, suddenly…

The GM rolls an attack check against Princess, getting a 15 result. Normally this would miss her Dodge defense of 18, but this is
a surprise attack, so Princess is vulnerable and her Dodge is halved to 4, rather than 8, making the DC a 14.

ground  speed  minus  one  rank,  if  you  choose.  If  you  fail,
you are still grabbed.

GRAB

You  attempt  to  grab  a  target.  Make  an  attack  check
against the target. If successful, the target makes a resis-
tance check against your Strength (or the rank of a grab-
bing effect) using the better of Strength or Dodge. If you
win with one degree of success, the target is restrained
(immobile  and  vulnerable). Two  or  more  degrees  leave
your  opponent  bound  (defenseless,  immobile,  and  im-
paired).  You  can  attempt  to  improve  an  existing  hold
with another grab action on a following turn. Any result-
ing  degrees  of  success  are  cumulative,  but  if  you  lose,
the target escapes.

You  are  hindered  and  vulnerable  while  grabbing  and
holding an opponent. You can maintain a successful grab
as a free action each turn, but cannot perform other ac-
tions requiring the use of your grabbing limb(s) while do-
ing so. Since maintaining a grab is a free action, you can
take a standard action to inflict your Strength damage to
a grabbed target on subsequent turns after the grab is es-
tablished.

You can drag a restrained or bound target along with you
when  you  move.  The  target  gets  a  Strength  resistance
check  against  your  Strength.  If  it  fails,  you  move  and  the
target moves along with you. If the target resists, you are
immobilized that turn unless you release your hold on the
target.

You can end a grab (releasing your target) as a free action.
If you are unable to take the free action maintain the hold,
the target is automatically released. A target can attempt
to escape from a grab as a move action (see Escape).

MOVE

You can move up to your normal speed rank in any move-
ment mode available to you as a move action. Normally
this is rank 0 ground speed for most people (up to 30 feet).
If  you  choose  to  move  twice  on  your  turn  (taking  two
move actions) then you move your speed rank each time.
You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to
run faster: one or more degree of success increases your
ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

READY

Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you
would normally act on your initiative, but before your ini-
tiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so
you can move as well.

If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed
your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied ac-
tion, y

pass through solid objects permeable to your type of en-
ergy, but energy resistant barriers, like heavy shielding or
force fields, block your movement.
RANK 4 - INCORPOREAL

You  can  assume  a  less  solid  form,  with  each  Insubstantial
rank becoming progressively less solid. You do not gain the
ability to assume lower-ranked Insubstantial forms at higher
ranks, but you can acquire a lower-ranked form as an Alter-
nate Effect of a higher-ranked one. You can switch between
normal and Insubstantial form at will as a free action once
per  round.  The  default  is  that  substantial  is  your “normal”
form, but the GM may permit you to make Insubstantial your
“normal” form, in which case remaining solid is a sustained
duration for you! Insubstantial offers four ranks of effect:

You  become  an  incorporeal  phantom.  You  can  pass
through solid matter at your normal speed and you have
Immunity to Physical and Energy Damage. Sensory effects
(other than tactile) and those targeting Will still work on
you,  as  do  effects  with  the  Affects  Insubstantial  modi-
fier. Choose one other reasonably common effect or de-
scriptor that works on you while you are incorporeal. You
have no effective Strength and cannot affect the physical
world, except with effects with the Affects Corporeal mod-
ifier. Your sensory effects work normally.

RANK 1 - FLUID

You become a fluid mass. You can flow through any sort of
opening,  under  (or  around)  doors,  through  keyholes  and
pipes,  and  so  forth.  You  cannot  pass  through  watertight
seals. You can automatically flow out of any restraint—such
as a snare or grab—that is not watertight. So you cannot flow
out of a bubble completely enclosing you, for example, but
anything  less  cannot  hold  you. You  can  exert  your  normal
Strength and can still push or carry objects, although your
manual dexterity may be limited (at the GM’s discretion).

A  fluid  character  may  attempt  to  catch  a  falling  person
or  object,  cushioning  the  fall  with  the  character’s  flex-
ible  form. This  requires  a  move  action,  and  reduces  the
falling damage by the cushioning character’s Toughness
bonus (representing flexibility in this case). Both charac-
ters  must  make  resistance  checks  against  the  remaining
damage. Higher rank insubstantial forms—lacking physi-
cal Strength—cannot attempt this.

Effect:  Perception  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Re-

You  can  impose  your  will  on  others,  forcing  them  to
obey  your  commands. Targets  failing  a Will  resistance
check against your effect DC first become dazed, then
compelled, as they try to fight off your influence. Finally,
with  three  or  more  degrees  of  effect,  the  target  be-
comes controlled and obeys any commands you give.

Degrees  of  failure  on  resistance  checks  against  Mind
Control are cumulative. You can also apply the Progres-
sive modifier (see the Affliction effect) so your mental
hold  increases  each  time  the  target  fails  a  resistance
check against it!

You can read another character’s mind. To use Mind Read-

Personal thoughts: You can probe deeper
into  the  target’s  mind  for  information. You
can  essentially  ask  any  one  question  and
receive  the  answer  from  the  target’s  mind.
If the target doesn’t know the answer, then
you know that as well.

Memory: You can read the subject’s memo-
ries  and  recollections.  This  allows  you  to
perceive  them  exactly  as  the  target  recalls
them, one memory per round.

Subconscious:  You  can  read  memories

the  target  does  not  consciously  know. This

Accident:  The  Mystic  commands  incredible  super-
natural powers, but sometimes those powers get out
of control, or awaken sleeping horrors, or cause other
unintended consequences that have to be dealt with.

Enemy: Some Mystics are plagued by enemies who
want to displace them or steal their power.

Honor:  It’s  not  uncommon  for  a  Mystic  to  follow  a
code of conduct that keeps them on the straight and
narrow,  perhaps  because  it’s  the  right  thing  to  do,
perhaps because they need to in order to keep their
powers in check.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Mystics  are  often  either
not from Earth or were trained in the mystic arts on
another  world. When  they  come  to  this  plane  they
use their talents to help others and hopefully earn a
place for themselves on their adopted world.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Mystic was given
his  or  her  power  for  a  reason—to  defend  Earth,  to
hunt down otherworldly creatures, or any number of
other options. Or perhaps the Mystic recognizes that
his or her power comes with a price.

•

Power  Loss:  Mystics  often  have  the  Complication
that  prevents  them  from  using  their  powers  when
they can’t move and/or speak to cast their spells.

Prejudice: Some Mystics are surrounded by an aura
of “otherness”  that  sets  them  apart  from  the  rest  of
humanity and makes it difficult for them to interact
with others. Or, maybe people just fear witches.

PARAGON

Paragons are what people first think of when they think
of superheroes. A Paragon is nearly perfect in every way:
fast, strong, tough, often has the ability to fly, and repre-
sents everything good about humanity. Paragons are of-
ten talented in a wide range of areas and easily take on
leadership roles.

self to be carried along in the direction of the wind hori-
zontally. –1 cost per rank.

Platform: Your Flight is reliant on some sort of platform on
which  you  stand  or  sit.  If  you  fail  a  resistance  check  while
flying,  or  you  are  grabbed  by  someone  standing  on  the
ground, you’re knocked or pulled off your platform and can-
not fly. You can regain the use of your flying platform by reac-
tivating your Flight effect on your next turn. –1 cost per rank.

Wings: You have wings that allow you to fly, but they run
the risk of being fouled or restrained, which prevents you
from flying. If you are immobilized, restrained, or bound,
you cannot fly. You can regain the use of your wings by
reactivating  your  Flight  effect  once  you  are  no  longer
affected  by  the  aforementioned  conditions.  –1  cost
per rank.

GROWTH

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily increase your size, gaining Strength
and  Stamina  at  the  cost  of  becoming  a  bigger,  heavier,
less agile target, unable to maneuver through small spac-
es. Growth modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

Each  rank  of  Growth  adds  1  rank  to  your  Strength  and
Stamina  (constructs  add  1  rank  to  Strength  and Tough-
ness if they lack Stamina) and adds 1 rank to your mass.
Every  two  ranks  adds  a  +1  bonus  to  Intimidation.  Every
8 ranks adds 1 to your Speed. Every rank of Growth sub-
tracts 1 from your Stealth checks. Every 2 ranks (rounded
up) subtracts 1 from your Dodge and Parry defenses. Ev-
ery  4  ranks  of  Growth  increases  your  size  rank  by  1  (or-
dinary humans start out at size rank –2, between 3 and
6  feet  tall).  So  at  Growth  8,  you  have  +8  Strength  and
Stamina,  +4  to  Intimidation,  +1  Speed,  but  -8  to
Stealth,  –4  Dodge  and  Parry,  and  you  are  size
rank 0 (around 30 feet tall). Increases to your
Strength and Stamina also improve related
traits like your Strength Damage, Forti-
tude, and Toughness.

any attack made on you until the start of your next turn.
Add  10  to  any  roll  of  10  or  less  that  you  make  on  these
checks, just as if you spent a hero point (thus ensuring a
minimum  roll  of  11). The  attacker  must  equal  or  exceed
your opposed check result in order to hit you.

DELAY

NO ACTION

When you delay, you choose to take your turn later in the
initiative order. You must delay your entire turn. You can-
not delay if you have already taken an action on your turn,
or if you are unable to take actions.

At any point after any other character in the conflict has
acted,  you  can  choose  to  take  your  turn.  Your  initiative
moves into the new place in the order where you act, and
you take your normal allocation of actions. If you do not
act before your initiative comes up in the next round, your
turn ends, you lose your delayed turn, and your initiative
remains where it is.

Beneficial effects lasting until the end of your turn end
when you choose to delay, but harmful effects that last
until  the  end  of  your  turn  last  until  after  you  act.  Like-
wise, you do not make resistance checks until after you
have taken your turn, so delaying can draw out some ef-
fects.

DISARM

You attempt to knock an item—such as a weapon or de-
vice—out of an opponent’s grasp. Make an attack check

against the defender with a –2 penalty. If you attempt to
disarm with a ranged attack, you are at –5 penalty. If your
attack succeeds, make an opposed check of your attack’s
damage  against  the  defender’s  Strength.  If  you  win,  the
defender dropped the held object. If you made the disarm
unarmed, you can grab the dropped object as a free ac-
tion. If you make a disarm attempt with a melee weapon
and lose the opposed check, the defender may immedi-
ately make an attempt to disarm you as a reaction; make
another opposed damage vs. Strength check. If this dis-
arm attempt fails, you do not, however, get an additional
attempt to disarm the defender.

Dropping a held item is a free action (although dropping
or  throwing  an  item  with  the  intention  of  hitting  some-
thing with it is a standard attack action).

Dropping  to  a  prone  position  is  a  free  action,  although
getting up requires a move action (see Stand).

LIGHT

You  can  raise  the  light  level  in  the  area,  countering  the
concealment of darkness, but not other forms of conceal-
ment. For 1 point per rank, you can create enough light to
reduce  total  concealment  to  partial  and  partial  conceal-
ment  to  none.  For  2  points  per  rank,  you  can  shed  light
as bright as a sunlit day, eliminating all concealment pro-
vided  by  natural  darkness.  Power  effects  with  the  dark-
ness descriptor may be countered with a successful power
check (see Countering Effects, page 148).

You impose a -2 modifier to Perception checks for 1 point
per rank, and a -5 for 2 points per rank. For more signifi-
cant  obscuring  of  senses  (via  darkness,  fog,  etc.)  use  an
Area Concealment Attack effect (see Concealment in this
chapter).
EXTRAS

Selective: With this extra you can vary the environment
within your affected area, affecting some while not affect-
ing  others,  or  even  mixing  and  matching  different  envi-
ronments (making part of the area cold and another hot,
for example). +1 cost per rank.

GENERAL

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  have  extra  manipulative  limbs,  such  as  arms,  tenta-
cles, or even prehensile hair or a tail. Each rank in this ef-
fect grants you an extra limb.

Extra  Limbs  do  not  allow  you  to  take  additional  actions
in a round, although they do provide the benefits of the
Improved Grab advantage—grabbing with some of your
limbs and leaving others free. All additional limbs except
your dominant limb are considered your “off-hand.” If you
have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you have no
off-hand penalties with any of your limbs.

If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than
taking the option to leave some of them free), you gain a

HOOD: EXTRA LIMBS, NOT EXTRA ACTIONS

As a default, Extra Limbs do not grant characters the abil-
ity to take extra actions in a round, simply because multi-
ple actions—especially extra standard actions usable for
attacks—tend to slow down and unbalance play.

As  an  option  for  including  some  combat  benefits  with
Extra  Limbs,  consider  allowing  the  application  of  the
Multiattack extra to the Strength of a character with Extra
Limbs, reflecting the ability to launch a flurry of attacks
at a single opponent, or to “spread” those attacks among
a number of nearby opponents. See the Multiattack de-

than permanent. The effect can be turned on and off and
can be improved using extra effort, including using it to
perform  stunts  (see  Extra  Effort).  Sustained  Protection
might be a power like a personal force field, or the ability
to consciously harden your skin and turn it into armor. +0

QUICKNESS

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  can  perform  routine  tasks—anything  that  can  be
done as a routine check (see Routine Checks in The Ba-
sics  chapter)—fast,  perhaps  very  fast.  Subtract  your  ef-
fect rank from the normal time rank to perform a task to
determine how long it takes you. So, for example, if you
have Quickness 7, a routine task normally taking an hour
(time rank 9) takes you (9 – 7 = time rank 2) 30 seconds.
Non-routine checks are not affected by Quickness, nor is
movement speed.

If you can perform a task in less than a second (time rank
–2), the GM may choose to treat that task as a free action
for you (although the GM can still limit the number of free
actions you can accomplish in a turn as usual).

FASCINATE

SKILL, RANKED

COMBAT

One of your interaction skills is so effective you can cap-
ture  and  hold  other’s  attention  with  it.  Choose  Decep-
tion,  Intimidation,  or  Persuasion  when  you  acquire  this
advantage. You can also use Fascinate with an appropri-
ate  Expertise  skill,  like  musician  or  singer,  at  the  GM’s
discretion.

You  are  subject  to  the  normal  guidelines  for  interaction
skills, and combat or other immediate danger makes this
advantage  ineffective. Take  a  standard  action  and  make
an  interaction  skill  check  against  your  target’s  opposing
check (Insight or Will defense). If you succeed, the target is
entranced. You can maintain the effect with a standard ac-
tion each round, giving the target a new resistance check.
The effect ends when you stop performing, the target suc-
cessfully resists, or any immediate danger presents itself.
Like all interaction skills, you can use Fascinate on a group,
but  you  must  affect  everyone  in  the  group  in  the  same
way.

You may take this advantage more than once. Each time, it
applies to a different skill.

FAST GRAB

COMBAT

When  you  hit  with  an  unarmed  attack  you  can  immedi-
ately make a grab check against that opponent as a free
action (see Grab, page 248). Your unarmed attack inflicts
its normal damage and counts as the initial attack check
required to grab your opponent.

COMBAT

You  have  an  environment  you’re  especially  suited  for
fighting  in.  Examples  include  in  the  air,  underwater,  in
space, in extreme heat or cold, in jungles or woodlands,
and so forth. While you are in your favored environment,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack checks or your
active defenses. Choose at the start of the round whether
the bonus applies to attack or defense. The choice remains
until the start of your next round. This circumstance bonus
is not affected by power level.

SKILL

You have a particular type of opponent you’ve studied or
are especially effective against. It may be a type of creature
(aliens, animals, constructs, mutants, undead, etc.), a pro-
fession (soldiers, police officers, Yakuza, etc.) or any other
category  the  GM  approves.  Especially  broad  categories
like “humans” or “villains” are not permitted. You gain a +2
circumstance  bonus  on  Deception,  Intimidation,  Insight,
and Perception checks dealing with your Favored Foe. This
circumstance bonus is not limited by power level.

about smugglers unloading a shipment down at the docks late at night, have staked-out the vessel. Once they see the
smugglers moving the goods, Rook signals it is time to move in and take them down!

ROUND 1

Gamemaster (GM): Okay, everyone, make an initiative check.

The players of Princess, Rook, and Ultramarine each roll the die, adding their character’s initiative modifier and getting the fol-
lowing results: Ultramarine: 13, Rook: 11, Princess: 26!

The GM rolls one initiative check for the smugglers (with an initiative modifier of +0), getting a result of 11. Although Rook has
the same result, he has a higher initiative modifier (+5) and so will go before the smugglers. The GM also rolls a secret initiative
check result of 16 for something the players don’t know yet...

GM: Okay, you get the “go” signal from Rook and leap into action! (Looking at the initiative count) Princess, what do you
do?

Princess: I jump from the pier onto the deck of the ship as my move action, landing right in front of all the smugglers
and say, “You guys want to just give up now and save yourselves a beating? Please feel free to say no.” Then I give them a
big smile.

GM: You want to try and intimidate them? That’s a standard action. You want to make it a routine check?

Princess: No, I’ll roll for it. Princess’ player rolls an Intimidation check with her bonus of +6. I got a 16 anyway, same as my
routine check result!.

The GM compares Princess’ result to the smugglers’ Will defense, which is 12. Her check succeeded with one degree. The smug-
glers are impaired (–2 on their checks) until the end of Princess’ next turn.

GM: The smugglers look shocked at your sudden appearance and hesitate, clearly shaken. Ultramarine, it’s your turn.

Ultramarine: Like shooting fish in a barrel… I surge up out of the water on the other side of the ship and fly up to the
deck (move action) then level the arm with my netline primed at the smugglers, my voice amplified by the speakers in my
suit. “Or you can call it quits right now.”

GM: You going for the Intimidation check, too?

Ultramarine: No, I think I’d rather ready an attack with my netline, if any of the smugglers decide to get stupid, then wait
to see what happens. That’s a standard action, right

Effect: Variable (assumed forms), Move Action • 8 points
per rank

You  can  transform  into  different  forms,  gaining  the
physical  traits  (abilities,  skills,  advantages,  and  pow-
ers) of the assumed form. You gain (Shapeshift rank x 5)
power points worth of traits. You can also redistribute
points spent on your own physical traits (lowering your
Strength to apply those points elsewhere, for example).
You are limited to the inherent traits of the forms you
assume and do not gain new mental traits, even if that
form possesses them.

Shapeshift is often further Limited by the specific types
of forms the character can assume, such as Limited to
Animals or Limited to Machines.

ter’s perceptions are unreliable, the sense appears to work,
but the character gets the wrong information. For this rea-
son, the GM should make all reliability checks for Senses
in secret, just informing the player of what the character
does (or does not) notice. –1 cost per rank.

SHRINKING

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily decrease your size, becoming smaller,
harder to see — and hit — at the cost of losing Strength
and  speed.  Every  4  ranks  of  Shrinking  reduces  your  size
rank by 1 (normal humans are size rank –2 by default) and
each reduction in size rank subtracts 1 from your Strength
and every two reductions in size rank subtract 1 from your
ground speed rank. Add half your Shrinking rank (rounded
down)  to  your  active  defenses.  Add  your  Shrinking  rank
as a bonus to Stealth checks, since you are harder to spot,
but apply half your rank (rounded down) as a penalty to In-
timidation checks (hard to be imposing when you’re tiny).
Shrinking modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

So  at  Shrinking  12,  you  are  size  rank  –5  (about  6  inches
tall),  and  have  a  +6  bonus  to  active  defenses  and  +12
Stealth bonus, but –3 Strength, –1 speed, and –6 Intimida-
tion penalties.
EXTRAS

Atomic: At Shrinking 20 (and size rank –7), you can shrink
down to the molecular or even atomic level, allowing you
to pass through solid objects by slipping between their at-
oms. It takes at least a full turn to do so, possibly longer for
larger objects. You’re effectively immune to damage and
many effects at this scale, since you are essentially shifted
out of the ordinary universe. The GM decides if a particular
effect can reach you at the atomic level. If you have

Limited: You must specify a reasonably common effect
(or set of uncommon effects) that keeps you from recov-
ering from death, such as beheading, cremation, a stake
through the heart, and so forth. Even then, if the effect is
somehow removed or reversed (e.g. the stake is removed
from your corpse) you may still be able to come back. -1
cost per rank.

IMMUNITY

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You are immune to certain effects, automatically succeeding
on  any  resistance  check  against  them. You  assign  ranks  of
Immunity to various effects to gain immunity to them (with
more extensive effects requiring more ranks). These assign-
ments are permanent. Examples include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

1  rank:  aging,  disease,  poison,  one  environmental
condition  (cold,  heat,  high  pressure,  radiation,  or
vacuum), one type of suffocation (breathe normally
underwater or in an alien atmosphere, for example),
starvation and thirst, need for sleep, or a rare power
descriptor (such as your own powers, a close sibling’s
powers, etc.).

2 ranks: critical hits, suffocation effects (no need to
breathe  at  all),  or  an  uncommon  power  descriptor
(such as chemical, gravitic, necromantic, etc.).

5 ranks: alteration effects, sensory Affliction effects,
emotion  effects,  entrapment  (grabbing,  snares,  or
bonds), fatigue effects, interaction skills, or a particu-
lar  Damage  effect,  descriptor  (such  as  bullets,  cold,
electricity, falling, fire, magic, radiation, sonic, etc.)

10 ranks: a common power descriptor (such as all ef-
fects with cold, electricity, fire, radiation, or weather
descriptors,  for  example),  life  support  (includes  im-
munity  to  disease,  poison,  all  environmental  condi-
tions, suffocation, and starvation and thirst).

20  ranks:  a  very  common  power  descriptor  (blud-
geoning or energy, for example).

30 ranks: All effects resisted by Fortitude, All effects
resisted by Will.

•

80  ranks:  All  effects  resisted  by  Toughness  (the
equivalent of 40 ranks of Impervious Toughness).

Some Immunity effects are a matter of degree. For exam-
ple, “immunity to cold” can range from the environmen-
tal effects of cold (described under The Environment) to
cold damage, to complete immunity to all effects with the
“cold”  descriptor. The  first  requires  only  1  rank,  and  pro-

people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a
specific circumstance or complication may call for a dif-
ferent attitude.

You  can  improve  others’  attitudes  with  a  DC  15  Persua-
sion  check.  Success  improves  the  subject’s  attitude  by
one  step,  while  every  two  additional  degrees  of  success
improve it by another step (so two steps at three degrees,
three  steps  at  five  degrees,  and  so  forth).  Failure  means
no change, and more than a degree of failure worsens the
subject’s attitude by one step! In the case of a hostile sub-
ject, they may outright attack or otherwise interfere with
you if their attitude worsens.

ATTITUDES

ATTITUDE

EFFECT

Hostile

Will take risks to attack
or interfere with you.

Unfavorable

Will insult, mislead,
or otherwise cause you trouble.

Indifferent

Favorable

Helpful

Acts as socially expected
towards you.

Will chat, advise,
and offer limited help.

Will take risks to
help or protect you.

Persuading someone is at least a standard action, usually
quite a bit longer. The GM decides if you can persuade at
all once a conflict has broken out! Even if the initial check
succeeds,  the  other  character  can  only  be  persuaded  so
far;  you  can  try  again  in  the  same  scene,  but  you  check
against the subject’s initial attitude, and may end up wors-
ening it rather than improving it!

Example:  The  heroes  must  convince  the  imperi-
ous King of Atlantis that the surface world is not
responsible  for  recent  attacks  against  his  king-
dom  in  order  to  avert  a  war.  The  king’s  attitude
is  unfavorable  towards  these  surface-world  in-
terlopers  to begin with. The team’s spokesperson
makes  a  Persuasion  attempt  and  gets  a  check
result  of  22,  a  success  with  two  degrees  total.
That  shifts  the  king’s  attitude  one  step,  to  indif-
ferent. He’s inclined to continue negotiating with
the heroes and willing to place the assault on the
surface world on-hold for the time-being. The he-
roes try to convince the king further, but any ad-
ditional checks need at least the same degree of
success as the first to get his attitude to favorable,
where he is willing to call off the attack, and more
than one degree of failure on any check moves his
attitude to hostile, where he orders the intruders
arrested and the attack to begin at once!

manoids, animals, machines, and so forth. At rank 4 you
can assume any form of the same mass as your own.

For the ability to change size as well as appearance see the
Growth and Shrinking effects. To take on the other traits of
forms you assume, see the Metamorph extra, following, or
the Variable effect, later in this chapter.
EXTRAS

Attack:  A  Morph  Attack  imposes  a  different  appearance
on  the  target  creature.  Unlike  an  Affliction  that  imposes
the transformed condition, a Morph Attack is entirely cos-
metic: you can’t change the target’s traits other than ap-
pearance. +0 cost per rank.

Metamorph:  Morph  only  changes  your  appearance;  you
still  have  all  the  traits  of  your  normal  form. This  modifier
allows  you  to  have  an  alternate  set  of  traits,  essentially  a
complete  alternate  character  you  change  into,  one  set  of
traits per rank in Metamorph. You can switch between sets
of traits at will, once per round, as a free action. Your other
form(s) must have the same point total as you and are sub-
ject  to  the  same  power  level  limits. They  must  also  have
traits  suitable  to  your  Morph  effect.  For  example,  if  you
can only Morph into humanoid forms, then your alternate
forms all have to be humanoid. All of your forms must have
your full Morph effect as well; those power points cannot
be reallocated. The GM may require certain additional com-
mon traits for all of your forms, particularly mental abilities
and skills, if you retain them. Metamorph is best suited to
characters with defined sets of alternate traits. For a char-
acter able to transform into a virtually unlimited number of
forms with various traits, see the Variable effect later in this
chapter. Flat +1 point per rank of Metamorph.
FLAWS

Resistible: A Morph effect Resistible by Will is most likely
a mental illusion of some sort. Observers who succeed on
the Will  resistance  check  see  you  as  you  truly  are  rather
than in your Morph guise. This is in addition to the usual
Perception check to penetrate your disguise. If you have
the Metamorph extra, then targets that resist your effect
treat you as if you had your normal traits, and not those
granted by your Metamorph form. –1 cost per rank.

task is completed.

You  always  have  the  same

minion  automatically  has
a helpful attitude and does
its best to aid you and obey

tion (see Controlled in The Basics chapter). They have no
free will of their own and are completely under your direc-
tion. +1 cost per rank.

Heroic: The creatures you summon are not subject to the
minion rules, but treated like normal non-player charac-
ters. Additionally, they do not have the dazed condition
and take a full set of actions each round. Do not apply the
Active modifier to Heroic minions, as this modifier already
includes it. Gamemasters should be particularly cautious

fatigue that much harder for victims to fight off.

MOVEMENT

Movement effects allow characters to get around in vari-
ous  ways.  Some  provide  a  speed  rank  with  a  particular
form of movement—such as ground, air, or water—while
others offer different modes of movement, like walking on
walls or slithering along the ground like a snake.

Although  activating  a  movement  effect  is  typically  a  free
action, the character must still take a move action in order
to actually move using the effect. So, for example, the ac-
tion of the Flight effect is “free” and activating it grants the
character a Flight speed rank equal to the effect rank. Mov-
ing that speed rank still requires a move action, however.

SENSORY

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  grouped  into  sense
types, descriptors for how different sensory effects work. The
sense types, and some of the senses included in them, are:

•

•

•

•

•

Visual: normal sight, darkvision, infravision, low-light
vision, microscopic vision, ultravision, X-Ray vision

Auditory: normal hearing, sonar (accurate ultrason-
ic), ultrasonic hearing

Olfactory: normal smell and taste, scent

Tactile: normal touch, tremorsense

Radio: radio, radar (accurate radio)

•  Mental: mental awareness, Mind Reading, Precogni-

Sensory effects enhance or alter the senses. Some senso-
ry effects improve the user’s senses while others grant en-
tirely new senses or fool the senses in some way. Sensory
effects are typically a free action to activate and sustain, or
are permanent and always in effect.

•

tion, Postcognition

Special: This is the catchall for other sensory descrip-
tors  not  given  above,  including  unusual  senses  or
exotic descriptors like cosmic, gravitic, magical, and
so forth.

Using  powers  is  a  fairly  simple  matter.  Some  power  effects  work  automatically.  Others—particularly  those  affecting
other people—require some effort to use, like an attack check or a effect check. Powers affecting others allow resistance
checks against their effects.

In  some  cases,  you  may  be  required  to  make  an  effect
check  to  determine  how  well  an  effect  works.  A  power
check  is  just  like  any  other  check:  d20,  plus  the  power’s
rank,  plus  any  applicable  modifiers,  against  a  difficulty
class set by the Gamemaster. The results of various power
checks are described in this chapter.

Effect Check = d20 + rank +
modifiers vs. difficulty class

particular  task,  such  as  reading,  mathematical  calcula-
tions, and so forth. –2 cost per rank.

DEFENSE

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You recover quickly from damage. Remove penalties to
your  Toughness  checks  due  to  damage  equal  to  your
Regeneration rank each minute. You then recover other
damage  conditions  equal  to  your  Regeneration  rank
each minute, starting from your most severe condition.
Spread  this  recovery  out  evenly  over  a  minute  (10  ac-
tion  rounds).  So  with  Regeneration  5,  you  remove  a  –1
Toughness penalty every other round (every round with
Regeneration 10, and up to a –2 penalty per round with
Regeneration 20).

Characters  with  no  Stamina  do  not  heal  (see  Absent
Abilities in the Abilities chapter). One or more ranks of
Regeneration overcome this. An absent Stamina character
with Regeneration 1 recovers at a normal rate; additional
Regeneration ranks speed up that rate.
EXTRAS

conditions (see the Incurable modifier). +1 cost per rank.

cess  to  a  particular  source  to  replenish  yourself,  such  as
blood, electricity, sand, scrap metal, sunlight, and so forth.

Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1–5 points per rank

You can displace one or more of your senses over a dis-
tance, perceiving as if you were at that location, up to 60
feet away. Each additional rank increases your range one
distance rank, so rank 2 is 120 feet, rank 3 is 250 feet, and
so  on.  Remote  Sensing  overrides  your  normal  sense(s)
while  you  are  using  it.  Subjects  observed  via  Remote
Sensing can “feel” it with an Insight check (DC 10 + rank).

You can make Perception checks normally using your dis-
placed senses, taking the normal action to do so. To search
a  large  area  for  someone  or  something,  use  the  search

Quickness,  like  many  power  effects,  is  not  especially

(around  rank  13-14),  but  doesn’t  have  any  effect  on

Fragmentation  grenade:  A  common  military  grenade

Smoke grenade: A smoke grenade fills an area with thick
smoke  (colored  as  desired)  providing  total  concealment
to all visual senses.

Flash-bang  grenade:  A  flash-bang  grenade  gives  off  a
bright flash and a loud bang that can render targets tem-

porarily blind and deaf. A flash grenade affects only vision
and costs 12 points.

Sleep gas grenade: This grenade releases a gas with an
Affliction (Sleep) effect.

Tear gas grenade: This type of grenade releases a cloud
of  gas  that  irritates  the  eyes  and  lungs,  causing  tempo-
rarily blindness and nausea (an Affliction with dazed and
visually impaired, stunned and visually disabled, and inca-
pacitated effects).

Dynamite: A common explosive. The damage on the ta-
ble is for a single stick of dynamite. Each doubling of the
amount of explosive increases Damage rank by 1.

Plastic explosive: Another common explosive, which can
be worked into different shapes. The damage listed is for
a 1-lb block. Each doubling of the amount of explosive in-
creases Damage rank by 1.

ARMOR

With so many weapons and super-powered attacks around, characters may need armor to protect them. Some heroes
are innately tough enough to stand up to a lot of punishment, while others rely on their high Dodge and Parry ranks.
Others choose to wear armor, ranging from ancient metal armors to modern composites or ultra-modern battlesuits.

Armor provides a Protection effect, a bonus to Toughness. Like other equipment, armor bonuses do not stack with other
armor or effect bonuses, only the highest bonus applies, one of the reasons why tough heroes rarely, if ever, wear armor.

You can surround your body with an aura of damaging
energy or some similar effect. Anyone you touch or that
touches you must make a Toughness resistance check
against your aura’s Damage rank. You can turn your aura
on and off at will as a free action. If your Aura damages
some targets but not others, apply the Selective or Lim-
ited modifiers (depending on whether or not the selec-
tivity is under your control).

Reduced Trait: One or more of your traits is lowered while
others  are  enhanced. This  flaw  is  worth  as  many  points
as  the  reduction  in  the  affected  trait(s).  So,  for  example,
if you lose Intellect while you gain in Strength, treat the
value  of  the  lost  Intellect  ranks  as  the  value  of  the  flaw.
As with all flaws, the effect must still cost at least 1 power
point. Flat –points equal to the lowered trait.

You can generate and project a type of energy, such as
cold, electricity, fire, kinetic force, magnetism, radiation,
or  even  cosmic  energy,  in  a  damaging  blast  (see  the
Blast power).

Energy Control is further defined by the addition of Alter-
nate Effects (see Alternate Effects, page 188), expand-
ing what you can do with your control. For example, Cold
Control  might  let  you  lower  the  surrounding  tempera-
ture (Environment – Cold) or trap targets in ice (Affliction,
see  the  Snare  version).  Magnetic  Control  could  let  you
manipulate metallic objects (Limited Move Object) while
Electrical Control lets you generate an electrical pulse to
overload electronics (Burst Area Nullify Electronics). Add
as many Alternate Effects to your Energy Control as you
can afford, and consider some additional ones as options
for power stunts (see Powers Stunts, page 20).

TASK

Diagnose injuries and ailments.

Provide long-term care.

Revive dazed or stunned characters.

Stabilize dying character.

Treat diseases or poisons.

If  you  do  not  have  the  appropriate  medical  equipment
and supplies, you take a –5 circumstance penalty on your
check.  If  your  subject  has  a  particularly  unusual  biology
(an alien, for example) you may also suffer a circumstance
penalty.

You  can  use  the Treatment  skill  on  yourself,  but  only  to
diagnose,  provide  care,  or  treat  disease  or  poison.  You
take a –5 circumstance penalty on checks when treating
yourself.
DIAGNOSIS

You  can  diagnose  injuries  and  ailments  with  an  eye  to-
ward  further  treatment.  This  takes  at  least  a  minute.  At
the GM’s discretion, a successful diagnosis provides a +2
bonus  for  favorable  circumstances  on  further Treatment
checks.

Providing  care  means  treating  an  injured  patient  for  a
day or more. If successful, the patient further reduces the
recovery  time  by  1  rank  (see  Recovery  in  the  Action  &
Adventure chapter). You can provide care for up to your
Treatment rank in patients at one time.
REVIVE

You  can  remove  the  dazed  or  stunned  conditions  from
a  subject  (see  Conditions  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). The check to revive is a standard action. A suc-
cessful  check  removes  the  condition.  Other  conditions
the patient may have remain, so reviving someone inca-
pacitated due to fatigue still leaves the patient exhaust-
ed, for example, while awakening someone incapacitat-
ed due to damage still leaves the patient staggered. You

As a standard action, a successful Treatment check stabi-
lizes a dying character.

You can treat a character afflicted with a disease or poison.
Each time the character makes a resistance check against
the ailment, you make a Treatment check. One degree of
success provides the patient with a +2 circumstance bo-
nus to the resistance check, three or more degrees of suc-
cess provides a +5 circumstance bonus.

mimics  other’s  traits  is  limited  to  the  traits  its
subject(s)  possess;  a  Variable  effect  pro-
viding  you  with  traits  suitable  to  dif-
ferent shapes is limited by the form(s)
you  assume;  a  Variable  effect  pro-
viding  adaptations  is  limited  to  the
stimulus  to  which  it  adapts,  and
so  forth.  This  descriptor  does  not
reduce  the  effect’s  cost  unless  it’s
especially  narrow  or  limiting,  and
the GM is the final arbiter of what con-
stitutes  a  suitable  descriptor  and  which
descriptors are narrow enough to qualify
for a Limited flaw.

The  allocation  of  your  Variable  points  is
sustained,  so  if  you  stop  maintaining  your
Variable  effect  for  any  reason,  your  allo-
cated points “reset” to a “null” state: you lose
any temporary traits and must take the
action  necessary  to  reallocate  your
Variable  points  again  on  your  turn  to
regain  them.  Points  in  a  Continuous
Variable  effect  remain  where  you  set
them  without  maintenance,  unless  the
Variable  effect  itself  is  countered  or  nul-
lified.  Variable  effects  cannot  be  perma-
nent in duration by definition.

EXTRAS

Action: You can change the configuration of
your effect faster, although only a Reaction
Variable  can  change  more  often  than  once
per turn, and then only in response to its trig-
gering  circumstances.  Gamemasters  should
exercise  caution  with  Variable  effects  that
can be reconfigured as a free action or re-
action:  they  not  only  grant  tremendous
flexibility,  they  can  also  slow  down  game
play as the player considers virtually infinite
possibilities for each action using the Variable
effect. Move Action: +1 cost per rank . Free Action: +2 cost
per rank. Reaction: +3 cost per rank.

Affects Others: You can grant effects to someone
else. The subject granted the use of the effect con-
trols  its  configuration,  if  appropriate  for  its  descrip-
tors (although you retain the ability to withdraw use of the
effect altogether whenever you wish). Affects Others Only:
+0 cost per rank. Affects Others or yourself: +1 cost per rank.

Perception: Applied to a Ranged Affects Others Variable,
this extra allows you to grant the benefits of the effect to
any target you can accurately perceive. +1 cost per rank.

Ranged:  A Variable  effect  with  Affects  Others  may  have
the Ranged extra to improve the range at which you can
grant the effect to anoth

NO COVER

COVER

Targets may also hide behind obstructions to gain cover
against your attacks. Obstructions that do not physically
block  attacks  but  simply  make  the  target  harder  to  per-
ceive—such as lighting, fog, or foliage—provide conceal-
ment rather than cover.

Partial Cover applies a –2 circumstance penalty to your
attack check. It generally means about half of the target
is behind cover, such as around a corner, behind a tree or
pillar, or a low wall.

Total  Cover  applies  a  –5  circumstance  penalty  to  your  at-
tack check, with three-quarters or more of the target behind
cover, like a narrow window, or crouched behind a wall.

Damage  resistance  check,  for  example,  is  incapaci-
tated, regardless of the degree of failure.

•

Certain  traits  (like  the  Takedown  advantage)  are
more effective against or specifically target minions.

DEFENSES

Your defenses determine how difficult it is to hit you with
various attacks. Most attacks target your active defenses,
Dodge and Parry: close attacks target Parry while ranged
attacks target Dodge.

You  add  your  defense  rank  to  a  base  value  of  10  (like  a
routine  check)  to  determine  your  defense  class  against
an attack, which is the DC of the attack check:

If a target is completely behind cover, then you cannot at-
tack that target (although you can attack the cover itself ).

Defense Class = defense + 10

Cover  also  grants  a  circumstance  bonus  to  Dodge  resis-
tance  checks  against  area  effects  equal  to  its  penalty  to
attack checks, so long as the target has cover with respect
to the origin point of the effect. So someone behind total
cover also gains a +5 to Dodge checks against area effects.

MINIONS

Minions  are  minor  characters  subject  to  special  rules  in
combat, and generally easier to defeat than normal char-
acters.  Villains  often  employ  hordes  of  minions  against
heroes. The following rules apply to minions:

•  Minions  cannot  score  critical  hits  against  non-min-

ions.

•

•

Non-minions  can  make  attack  checks  against  min-
ions as routine checks.

 If a minion fails a resistance check, the minion suffers
the worst degree of the effect. So a minion failing a

So a hero with Parry 11 has a defense class of 21 (11 + 10)
against close attacks. If the same hero has Dodge 9, that is
a defense class of 19 (9 + 10) against ranged attack

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS
CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

As you can see, once you break it down, checks are actual-
ly fairly simple. All the Gamemaster has to say in response
to the player’s declaration is: “Okay, roll a Fighting check
to hit the villain,” letting the rest of the description stand
as what happens. Whether or not the hero is successful in
stopping the trap depends on the outcome of the attack
against the bad guy.

Of course, if the villain is expecting the hero, there might be
another trap, such as part of the catwalk rigged to fall away
under him, leaving him dangling above the acid vat and at
the villain’s mercy! In that case, the GM would respond to
the  player’s  description: “You  smash  through  the  skylight
and swing over to the catwalk, but when you do...” and go
on to describe what follows. The rest of the hero’s intended
action(s) are null and void, because things don’t always go
as planned when you’re dealing with cunning supervillains!

Checks are used to resolve all outcomes in MUTANTS & MAS-
TERMINDS,  so  once  you  understand  the  basic  concept,  the
rest is easy. For detailed examples of how to use checks in
the game and their effects, see the Action & Adventure
chapter.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored a critical success. Determine the degree of success
normally and then increase it by one degree. This can turn
a low-level success into something more significant, but
more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-fledged
success! A critical success with an attack check is called a
critical hit, discussed later in this chapter and in the Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter.

Checks are made against a difficulty class or DC, a num-
ber set by the GM, which your check must equal or exceed
to achieve success. So for a task with a DC of 15 you must
roll a check total of 15 or greater to succeed. In some cas-
es, the results of a check vary based on how much higher
or lower the result is than the DC, known as its degree of
success or failure.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Lady  Liberty,  rescuing  people  from  a
tenement  fire,  is  hemmed-in  by  collapsed  debris.
Her player decides to simply punch a path through.
Since  she’s  going  for  maximum  damage,  she  de-
cides  to  make  the  attack  check  normally  (rather
than a routine check). Given her attack bonus, she’ll
only miss on a natural 1 anyway. She succeeds and
does her Strength in Damage, +5 for the automatic
critical. The GM decides the brick, mortar, and heavy
beams have a toughness of 9 and makes a Tough-
ness  check,  rolling  a  5,  against  a  DC  30  (Lady  Lib-
erty’s Damage +15). A 14 result is three degrees of
failure, so she easily smashes through the debris and
clears the building, carrying people to safety!

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

Living targets remove one damage condition per minute
of  rest,  starting  from  their  worst  condition  and  working
back. So a damaged character recovers from being inca-
pacitated, then staggered, dazed, and finally removes a –1
Toughness check penalty per minute until fully recovered.
The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications  (see  Lasting Injuries  in  the  Recovery section
of the Action & Adventure chapter).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Ranged, Progressive Affliction, Resisted by Forti-
tude • 4 points per rank

You  render  the  target  unable  to  breathe.  Targets  fail-
ing  the  Fortitude  resistance  check  against  your  effect
DC become dazed, stunned, and finally incapacitated,
passing out from the lack of oxygen. A failed attempt
to  resist  the  ongoing  effect  of  Suffocation  causes  the
target’s condition to worsen by one degree.

ent than “heat ray” is a descriptor for a Damage effect or
“sticky webbing” is a descriptor for a hindering Affliction;
in  neither  case  does  the  character  need  Summon  Heat
Ray or Summon Webbing to create the desired powers!

SWIMMING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-
scribe it, such as “inside the capitol building lobby” or “atop
the  Emerald  Tower’s  roof.”  If  the  destination  isn’t  in  your
Teleport range, nothing happens. +1 cost per rank.

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

245

A successful attack has some effect on the target. Typical-
ly this is an effect from the Powers chapter, such as Dam-
age or Affliction. The effect has a rank, used to determine
a difficulty class for the target’s resistance check.

Resistance Difficulty = effect rank + 10

The target of the attack makes a resistance check against
the effect to determine what, if anything, happens.

Some  effects  are  not  resisted  just  once,  but  multiples
times. The later resistance checks represent how fast the
target is able to “shake off” the effect. Make a resistance
check  for  the  target  of  an  ongoing  effect  at  the  end  of
each  of  the  target’s  turns.  A  successful  check  ends  the
effect  and  removes  conditions  imposed  by  it.  A  failure
means  the  effect’s  conditions  persist,  as  given  in  the  ef-
fect’s description.

Example: Captain Thunder was hit by a Affliction
effect, leaving him blinded. At the end of his turn,
he makes a Fortitude resistance check against the
effect’s  DC  to  try  and  shake  it  off,  but  missed  the
check  by  2.  His  next  turn,  still  blind,  he  stumbles
and tries to strike the foe taunting him. At the end
of his turn, he makes another resistance check. Suc-
cess! He ends the Affliction effect and removes the
blinded condition. Next turn, the villain had better
watch out!

A  failed  resistance  check  against  an  attack  imposes  one
or more conditions on the target, depending on the type
of effect and the degree of failure. See the effect descrip-
tion and the Conditions section of The Basics chapter for
more on the various conditions.

ACTIONS

The  most  common  actions  characters  take  during  con-
flicts  are  listed  and  described  here.  The  GM  should  use
these as guidelines for dealing with unusual actions play-
ers may choose for their characters, basing them on the
existing action descriptions.

AID

If you are in position to attack an opponent, you can at-
tempt to aid an ally engaged in melee with that oppo-
nent as a standard action. This is like a team check (see
Team  Checks  in  The  Basics  chapter): You  make  an  at-
tack check against DC 10. If you succeed, you don’t actu-
ally hit or affect the opponent, but success grants your
ally  gains  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on  an  attack  check
against  that  opponent  or  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  to

Defense  against  that  opponent  (your  choice)  until  the
end  of  your  ally’s  next

The Totem is a superhero whose powers are closely tied to
a particular animal. The Totem may have acquired its pow-
ers  through  an  accident  of  science,  an  invocation  of  the
animal spirits, or may even be an exceptional, self-aware
animal. Totem heroes tend to be as varied as the animals
they represent, and they can resemble other archetypes
such as the Martial Artist, Warrior, and Powerhouse.

EXTRAS

Action: This extra reduces the action required for you to
use Healing. You cannot use Healing more than once per
turn  regardless. To  heal  multiple  subjects  at  once,  apply
the Area modifier. +1 cost per rank.

Affects Objects: Your Healing can also “heal” damage to
non-living  subjects.  You  make  a  Healing  check  against
the subject’s worst damage condition, as normal. +1 cost
per rank.

Area: Healing with this extra grants the same benefit to all
subjects in the affected area. Area Empathic Healing (see
this power’s Flaws) is an unwise combination, as the heal-
er takes on all of the damage conditions of the affected
subjects at once! +1 cost per rank.

Energizing: You can heal the fatigued and exhausted con-
ditions as well as damage conditions: DC 10, one degree of
success for fatigued, two degrees of success for exhausted.
However, you take on the removed conditions and cannot
use  Healing  to  eliminate  your  own  fatigue  (although  you
can still use hero points to recover from them). If the Heal-
ing check fails, you must wait the normal recovery time or
use extra effort to try again. +1 cost per rank.

Perception: Applied to Ranged Healing (following), Per-
ception Ranged Healing does not require an attack check
to “touch” the subject. +1 cost per rank.

Persistent: Your  Healing  can  remove  even  Incurable  ef-
fects (see the Incurable modifier). Flat +1 point.

Ranged:  Ranged  Healing  requires  an  attack  check  to
“touch” the subject with the Healing effect. The GM may
waive the check for a willing subject holding completely
still, but the subject is defenseless that round, making it an
unwise decision in the midst of combat. +1 cost per rank.

recover from it normally. You can use Healing and Regen-
eration to cure your own conditions. You can have the Res-
urrection modifier for Healing, but if you successfully use
it, you die! This may not be as bad as it seems if you have
Immortality, allowing you to return to life (see the Immor-
tality effect for details). –1 cost per rank.

Limited: Examples of ways in which Healing may be Lim-
ited include: One Type of Damage (such as energy or blud-
geoning  damage),  Objects  (in  conjunction  with  Affects
Objects), Others (you can’t use Healing on yourself), or Self
(you can only use Healing on yourself). –1 cost per rank.

CREATE

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless

-1 OR -2 COST PER RANK

An effect has a range of close, ranged, or perception. De-
creasing  an  effect’s  range  by  one  step  (from  ranged  to
close, for example) is worth 1 point per rank. Some effects
have  their  range  determined  by  rank. To  change  the  ef-
fect’s range, increase or decrease its rank; this flaw does
not apply. Effects that are close range by default cannot
further decrease their range.

REMOVABLE

FLAT • -1 OR -2 POINTS PER 5 POINTS

Removable applies to the power as a whole and not in-
dividual effects, although it may apply to a power with
only  one  effect.  The  flaw  is  worth  –1  point  (–2  points
for  Easily  Removable)  per  5  total  power  points  of  the
power’s final cost, rounded up, after applying extras and
flaws to its effects.

A removable power may only be removed when you are
both stunned and defenseless, essentially unable to resist,
and  cannot  be  removed  during  action  time. This  means
opponents can generally only remove the power after de-
feating you (leaving you incapacitated) or through some
sort of scheme outside of a conflict, such as a plot to break
into your headquarters and steal a device kept there, for
example.

An  easily  removable  power  can  be  taken  away  with  a
disarm  or  grab  action  (see  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). This typically represents some sort of handheld

device (such as a weapon, magic wand, remote control,
or the like) or some worn item easily snatched from you,
like a hat or cloak.

Removable applies to the power as a whole and not indi-
vidual effects, although it may apply to a power with only
one effect. The flaw is worth –1 point (–2 points for Easily
Removable) per 5 total power points of the power’s final
cost, after applying extras and flaws to its effects.

Example:  Ultramarine’s  armor  provides  Veronica
with  a  number  of  effects,  including  Damage,  En-
hanced  Strength,  Flight,  Protection,  and  Senses.
The total power point cost of all the armors effects
is 98 points, including extras and flaws applied to
those effects. Dividing the total cost by 5 is 20. So
the Removable flaw reduces the cost of the Ultra-
marine  armor  by  20  points,  from  98  to  78  power
points. However the armor can be taken away, dis-
abled, and so forth, and the player receives no hero
points for a complication when it happens due to
the nature of the flaw.

Removable  devices  can  be  damaged,  possib

fects separately, apply this flaw to each of them, requiring
separate actions for each.

FLAT • -1 POINT PER RANK

If Activation is not automatic, apply the Check Required
flaw to the entire power as well and have the player make
the necessary check in order to activate the power. If the
check fails, the power does not activate, and the character
has to take the activation action to try again.

The Activation flaw does allow permanent effects that are
part of a power to be turned off, but only if the power as a
whole is deactivated. It does not affect the other aspects
of permanent duration, including the inability to improve
the effect with extra effort. The GM should decide if allow-
ing a permanent effect to have an Activation is appropri-
ate based on the specific effect and any others it is com-
bined with in the power.

Example:  Stonewall  has  the  power  to  turn  into
a  super-strong  rock-form.  This  is  a  combination
of  the  Enhanced  Strength,  Impervious  Protec-
tion,  and  Power-Lifting  effects.  Stonewall’s  player
applies  the  Activation  flaw  to  the  power,  saying
Stonewall has to concentrate and take a standard
action  to  assume  his  rock-form.  That  reduces  the
total cost of all three effects by 2 power points and
means  unless  Stonewall  takes  a  standard  action
to activate his rock-form, he cannot use any of the
power’s  effects,  even  including  permanent  ones
like Protection.

An effect with this flaw requires a check of some sort—usually
a skill check—with a base difficulty of 10, +1 for each addition-
al rank in Check Required. If the check fails, the effect doesn’t
work, although the action required to use it is expended (so
attempting to activate a standard action effect takes a stan-
dard action whether the check is successful or not).

If the check succeeds, the character gains the use of 1 ef-
fect rank per point the check exceeds the DC. Thus a check
result of 14 allows the character to use up to 4 ranks of the
effect.  If  a  lesser  rank  of  the  effect  doesn’t  do  anything,
then it’s the same as failing the check.

The required check occurs as part of the action to use the
effect and provides no benefit other than helping to ac-
tivate it. Normal modifiers apply to the check, and if you
are unable to make the required check for any reason, the
effect doesn’t work.

A natural 1 rolled on the check means it fails automatical-
ly, regardless of the check result. So there is always

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

265

More  than  a  few  comic  books  speculate  about  the  fu-
ture. There are science fiction comics aplenty, along with
super-hero stories set at different points in Earth’s future.

A near future setting may be quite similar to the modern-
day, with the addition of some new technology and the
new problems that come with it. For example there may
be flying cars, cybernetic and genetic modifications, and
advances  in  computer  technology  along  with  increases
in crime and urban decay. Heroes can stalk the streets of
dark, towering cities trying to protect the innocent where
a corrupt legal system has failed.

Some  future  comic  stories  are  set  following  a  terrible
catastrophe  that  has  all  but  destroyed  civilization.  In  a
setting  like  this  the  heroes  may  be  the  last  survivors  of
ordinary  humanity,  or  super-powered  mutants,  trained
super-soldiers (perhaps intended as weapons in the Last
War), or even cyborgs or aliens. Their adventures tend to
revolve around protecting pockets of civilization from ma-
rauding  mutants  and  keeping  ambitious  warlords  from
conquering the world or destroying innocent people.

Far future settings feature faster-than-light space travel, al-
lowing heroes to visit (or come from) any of dozens or even
hundreds  of  different  worlds.  A  team  made  up  of  heroes
from  these  different  worlds  could  band  together  to  pro-
tect the interstellar government from hostile alien invaders
while also dealing with disasters, space pirates, and crimi-
nal  cartels.  Or  a  group  can  explore  the  unknown  reaches
of space on board a starship, encountering would-be con-
querors, despots, raiders, and other villains along the way.

STYLE

Just as comics themselves span the stylistic gamut from
lighthearted  adventure  to  intricately  plotted,  grim  mo-
rality  plays,  so  can  a  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  series  vary  in
style. Once a style of play is established, it’s up to the GM
to  maintain  it.  That  means  creating  adventures  and  en-
counters suited to that style and encouraging the players
to get into the style’s mindset and run their characters ac-
cordingly. Styles run along a spectrum from light to dark:

LIGHT

The light style is simple and straightforward. The heroes
are the good guys and the villains are usually bad through
and  through  (with  a  few  misunderstood  souls  in  need
of help). Problem solving is a matter of eith

As a descriptor, substitute any one energy type on the
list  below  (or  one  you  come  up  with)  in  place  of  the
word, “Energy,” or “Energy Control type,” above.

An  Energy  Controller’s  personality  often  reflect  the
energy type he or she controls, so the descriptions for
Abilities, Advantages, and Skills can help narrow down
which energy type fits your character if you prefer to as-
sign one to your hero.

•

Identity:  The  Paragon  often  hides  his  or  her  true
identity  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Often  the  Para-
gon feels that this “normal” identity keeps him or her
grounded and in touch with the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: The Paragon is motivat-
ed to be a hero because it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  The  Paragon  is  a  patriot
and fights to uphold the ideals of his or her country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Paragon  is  often
motivated  by  the  belief  that  with  power  comes  re-
sponsibility.

•

•

•

Power  Loss:  Usually  caused  by  transforming  back
to a normal human form, some Paragons lack access
to  their  powers  all  the  time.  If  you  choose  this  op-
tion, create a non-powered version of your character
that doesn’t have any of its Powers, has human-level
Abilities, and may even have lower ranks of Skills and
completely different Advantages.

Prejudice:  Some  Paragons  are  appear  inhuman  in
some way and are treated with distrust or fear by the
public.

Relationship:  Paragons  often  have  a  large  number
of  friends,  family,  or  fans  that  get  into  trouble  with
alarming frequency.

•  Weakness: Because the Paragon is so powerful in so
many ways, he or she often suffers from a crippling
weakness to a particular type of attack.

The Powerhouse is the strongest one there is! Where other
archetypes spread their points out amongst a number of
different  powers  and  abilities,  the  Powerhouse  concen-
trates  on  two  things:  strength  and  protection.  In  fights,
the Powerhouse is always on the front line, tearing it up
and,  even  so,  is  usually  the  last  one  standing. The  Pow-
erhouse  is  often  inhuman-looking,  either  because  he  or
she’s been turned into a hulking brute, or is from an alien
world, or is capable of transforming into living stone, steel,
or something equally resistant to damage.

powers or were mutated in a one-in-a-million
accident or experiment.

nuses for your character, paying 1 power point per +1 de-
fense over the base rank provided by your hero’s abilities.
To improve your hero’s Toughness, see Advantages and
Powers, following. See the Abilities chapter for details.
5. SKILLS

Choose  the  skill  ranks  you  want  your  character  to  have
and pay 1 power point per 2 total skill ranks. See the Skills
chapter for details.

6. ADVANTAGES

Choose the advantages you want your character to have
and pay 1 power point per advantage or rank in a advan-
tage. See the Advantages chapter for details.

7. POWERS

Create  your  hero’s  powers  by  choosing  their  desired  ef-
fects  and  paying  the  effects’  base  cost,  adjusted  for  any
modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks. See the
Powers chapter for details.
8. COMPLICATIONS

Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can
have more, if you want, and the more complications your
hero  faces,  the  greater  your  chances  for  earning  hero

points during the game. See the Complications section
of this chapter for details.
9. DETAILS

Go  through  the  limits  listed  under  Power  Level  in  this
chapter and make sure your hero’s traits all fit within them.
If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.

Go back through and add up the costs of your hero’s abili-
ties, defenses, skills, advantages, and powers. You should
end  up  with  a  figure  equal  to  the  starting  power  points
shown on the Starting Power Points table. If not, double-
check your math and either remove or add traits to your
character to reach the starting power point total.

Figure out things like your hero’s name, appearance, origin,
background, and motivation. If you can, consider creating a
sketch or detailed description of your hero’s costume.

10. GAMEMASTER APPROVAL

Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The
GM should check again to make sure your power points
are  spent  and  added  up  correctly,  your  hero  follows  the
power  level  guidelines  and  any  other  guidelines  set  for
the  series,  and  that  the  character  is  generally  complete
and  suited  to  the  overall  game.  Once  your  GM  has  ap-
proved, your new hero is ready for play!

You design a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero by spending pow-
er points on different traits. Each ability, skill, advantage,
power, and other trait has an associated power point cost.

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

type  can  be  used  as  anything  from  an  archaeologist  to

speed in the round, regardless of the number of attacks
you  make. You  stop  attacking  once  you  miss,  run  out  of
movement, or there are no more minions within range of
your attack.

You can transfer the benefits of a successful combat use of
an interaction skill to your teammate(s). For example, you
can feint and have your target vulnerable against one or
more allies next attack(s), rather than yours. Each rank in
the advantage lets you transfer the benefit to one ally. The
interaction skill check requires its normal action, and the
affected allies must be capable of interacting with you (or
at least seeing the set-up) to benefit from it.

TAUNT

SKILL

You  can  demoralize  an  opponent  with  Deception  rather
than  Intimidation  (see  Demoralize  under  the  Intimida-
tion skill description), disparaging and undermining con-
fidence  rather  than  threatening. Targets  resist  using  De-
ception, Insight, or Will defense.

SIDEKICK

GENERAL, RANKED

TEAMWORK

GENERAL

You  have  another  character  serving  as  your  partner  and
aide.  Create  your  sidekick  as  an  independent  character
with (advantage rank x 5) power points, and subject to the
series power level. A sidekick’s power point total must be
less than yours. Your sidekick is an NPC, but automatically
helpful  and  loyal  to  you.  Gamemasters  should  generally
allow you to control your sidekick, although sidekicks re-
main NPCs and the GM has final say in their actions.

Sidekicks  do  not  earn  power  points.  Instead,  you  must
spend earned power points to increase your rank in Side-
kick to improve the sidekick’s power point total and traits;
each  point  you  spend  to  increase  your  rank  in  Sidekick
grants  the  sidekick  5  additional  power  points.  Sidekicks
also do not have hero points, but you can spend your own
hero points on the sidekick’s behalf with the usual bene-
fits. Sidekicks are not minions, but full-fledged characters,
so they are not subject to the minion rules.

You’re  effective  at  helping  out  your  friends.  When  you
support a team check (see Team Checks in The Basics
chapter)  you  have  a  +5  circumstance  bonus  to  your
check.  This  bonus  also  applies  to  the  Aid  action  and

move  one  of  the  following  conditions  from  an  ally  with
whom you can interact: dazed, fatigued, or stunned.

LUCK

FORTUNE, RANKED (1/2 PL)

Once per round, you can choose to re-roll a die roll, like
spending a hero point (see Hero Points, page 20), includ-
ing adding 10 to re-rolls of 10 or less. You can do this a
number  of  times  per  game  session  equal  to  your  Luck
rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level
(rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero
points “reset”  at  the  start  of  an  adventure. The  GM  may
choose to set a different limit on ranks in this advantage,
depending on the series.

Generally speaking, languages are not terribly important
in comic book superhero stories except as background col-
or or occasional plot complications. Gamemasters should
allow  players  with  characters  fluent  in  other  languages
the occasional opportunity to show them off or put them
to good use. If you specifically set up the language barrier
as an obstacle by confronting the heroes with a language
they cannot possibly understand, that should count as a
complication and be worth a hero point.

COMBAT

MINION

GENERAL, RANKED

You can draw a weapon from a holster or sheath as a free
action, rather than a move action.

You have a follower or minion. This minion is an indepen-
dent  character  with  a  power  point  total  of  (advantage
rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level
limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions
(if capable of independent thought) automatically have a
helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the nor-
mal rules for minions (see page 245).

Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend
earned  power  points  to  increase  your  rank  in  this  advan-
tage to improve the minion’s power point total and traits.
Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are
replaced in between adventures with other followers with
similar abilities at the Gamemaster’s discretion.

ACTION

COMBAT

When taking a standard action and a move action you can
move both before and after your standard action, provid-
ed the total distance moved isn’t greater than your normal
movement speed.

COMBAT

When  you  make  a  power  attack  (see  Maneuvers,  page
250)  you  can  take  a  penalty  of  up  to  –5  on  your  attack
bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to the effect
bonus of your attack.

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

COMBAT

You  can  make  grab  attacks  with  only  one  arm,  leaving
the other free. You can also maintain the grab while using
your other hand to perform actions. You are not vulner-
able while grabbing (see Grabbing in the Action & Ad-
venture chapter).

COMBAT

Your grab attacks are particularly difficult to escape. Op-
ponents  you  grab  suffer  a  –5  circumstance  penalty  on
checks to escape.

COMBAT, RANKED

You have a +4 bonus to your initiative checks per rank in
this advantage.

COMBAT

You have no penalty to attack checks to hit an object held
by another character (see Smash in the Action & Adven-
ture chapter).

COMBAT

You  have  no  penalty  to  your  attack  check  to  trip  an  op-
ponent and they do not get the opportunity to trip you.
When  making  a  trip  attack,  make  an  opposed  check  of
your Acrobatics or Athletics against your opponent’s Ac-

robatics  or  Athletics,  you  choose  which  your  opponent
uses to defend, rather than the target choosing (see Trip
in the Action & Adventure chapter). This is a good martial
arts advantage for unarmed fighters.

SKILL

You ignore the circumstance penalty for using skills with-
out proper tools, since you can improvise sufficient tools
with whatever is at hand. If you’re forced to work without
tools at all, you suffer only a –2 penalty.

COMBAT, RANKED

When  wielding  an  improvised  close  combat  weapon—
anything from a chair to a telephone pole or entire car—
you use your Close Combat: Unarmed skill bonus for at-
tack checks with the “weapon” rather than relying on your
general Close Combat skill bonus. Additional ranks in this
advantage give you a +1 bonus to Damage with impro-
vised weapons per rank. Your maximum Damage bonus is
still limited by power level, as usual.

INSPIRE

FORTUNE, RANKED (5)

You can inspire your allies to greatness. Once per scene, by
taking a standard action and spending a hero point, allies
able to interact with you gain a +1 circumstance bonus per
Inspire rank on all checks until the start of your next round,
with a maximum bonus of +5. You do not gain the bonus,
only  your  allies  do.  The  inspiration  bonus  ignores  power

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

POWER

Increase one of your hero’s power effects by +1 rank until
the start of the hero’s next turn. Permanent effects cannot
be increased in this way.

Temporarily  gain  and  use  an  Alternate  Effect  (see  Alter-
nate Effect in  the  Powers chapter). The  Alternate  Effect
lasts until the end of the scene or until its duration expires,
whichever comes first. Permanent effects cannot be used
for power stunts.

Gain an immediate additional resistance check against an
ongoing effect. If you’re compelled or controlled, the fa-
tigue from the extra effort doesn’t affect you until you’re
free of the effect; this is so you can’t resist yourself to ex-
haustion as a way of avoiding being controlled!

RETRY

Certain effects (see the Powers chapter) require extra ef-
fort to retry after a certain degree of failure. The extra ef-
fort merely permits another attempt to use the effect; it
grants no other benefits.

SPEED

Hero points allow players to “edit” the plot of the adven-
ture and the rules of the game to a degree. They give he-
roes the ability to do the amazing things heroes do in the
comics, but with certain limits, and they encourage play-
ers to make the sort of choices heroes do in the comics, in
order to get more hero points.

Players start each game session with 1 hero point. During
the adventure they get opportunities to earn more hero
points. Players can use various tokens (poker chips, glass
beads,  etc.)  to  keep  track  of  their  hero  points,  handing
them over to the Gamemaster when they spend them. The
Gamemaster can likewise give out tokens when awarding
hero points to the players.

Unspent hero points don’t carry over to the next adven-
ture; the heroes start out with 1 point again. Use them or
lose them! Since hero points are a finite resource, players
need  to  manage  them  carefully,  spending  them  at  the
most opportune times and taking chances to earn them
through complications. Playing it “safe” tends to eliminate
chances  of  getting  more  hero  points  while  taking  risks,
facing complications, and, in general, acting like a hero of-
fers rewards that help them out later on.

Unless otherwise noted, spending a hero point is a reac-
tion,  taking  no  time,  and  you  can  spend  as  many  hero
points as you have. You can spend hero points for any of
the following:

Increase the hero’s speed rank by +1 until the start of the
hero’s next turn.

Increase the hero’s Strength rank by +1 until

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

You can use combinations of advantages—particularly combat advantages—to create different “fighting styles” rang-
ing from martial arts to superhero combat techniques. For example, a “soft” fighting style focusing primarily on defense
might include the advantages Defensive Attack, Improved Defense, Improved Trip, and Instant Up. A “hard” fighting style
focused on offense might include All-out Attack, Improved Critical, Improved Smash, Power Attack, and Startle for a fierce
kiai shout! You can combine various advantages to create specific styles or allow players to mix-and-match to design their
own unique styles.

Use the following advantage combos as examples of how to create different fighting styles. Students who have not yet
mastered a style may have only some of a style’s associated advantages rather than all of them.

Any of these fighting styles might include ranks of the Close Attack advantage. Other fighting style advantages might
include:

•

•

•

•

Boxing: All-out Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Power Attack, Takedown.

Judo: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Improved Trip.

Kung Fu: Defensive Attack, Improved Critical (Unarmed), Improved Smash, Improved Trip, Instant Up, Power Attack,
Startle.

Sword-fighting: Accurate Attack, Defensive Attack, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Power Attack, Taunt.

•  Wrestling: Chokehold, Fast Grab, Improved Grab, Improved Hold, Power Attack.

Comic book martial artists often have abilities far beyond the scope of the advantages and fighting styles given in this
chapter. Such superhuman martial arts abilities as leaping vast distances, punching through solid stone, shrugging off
damage, and killing with a mere touch are powers. See the Powers chapter for details.

bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to both your
active defenses (Dodge and Parry).

COMBAT, RANKED

You can avoid damage through agility and “rolling” with
an  attack. You  receive  a  bonus  to  your Toughness  equal
to your advantage rank, but it is considered an active de-
fense similar to Dodge and Parry (see Active Defenses in
the  Abilities  chapter),  so  you  lose  this  bonus  whenever
you  are  vulnerable  or  defenseless. Your  total Toughness,
including this advantage, is still limited by power level.

This advantage is common for heroes who lack either su-
perhuman speed or toughness, rely

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

The  bonus  from  a  Close  Combat  skill  applies  only  to  at-
tack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses. For
a broader bonus to attack checks that is less than simply
raising  Fighting  rank,  see  the  Close  Attack  advantage  in
the Advantages chapter.

DECEPTION

Presence • Interaction

Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you
want them to believe. It covers things like acting, bluffing,
fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.

Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story.
Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move
action by taking a –5 penalty to your check.

BLUFFING

Make  a  Deception  check  to  tell  a  believable  lie  or  get
someone do go along with you.

A  bluff  is  usually  opposed  by  the  target’s  Deception  or
Insight  check.  Favorable  and  unfavorable  circumstances
weigh  heavily  on  the  outcome.  Two  circumstances  can
work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what
you  ask  goes  against  the  target’s  self-interest,  nature,  or
personality.

If it’s important, you can distinguish between a deception
that  fails  because  the  target  doesn’t  believe  it  and  one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the tar-
get gets a +10 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands serious risk, and the resistance check succeeds
by 10 or less, then the target doesn’t so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the
target’s Insight check succeeds by 11 or more, he has seen
through  the  deception,  and  would  have  refused  even  if
it had not placed unusual demands on him (that is, even
without the +10 modifier).

MODIFIER

The target wants
to believe you.

The deception is believable
and doesn’t affect the target
much either way.

The deception is a little hard
to believe or puts the target at
some kind of risk.

The deception is difficult
to believe or entails
a serious risk.

The deception is way
out there, almost too
incredible to consider.

applies to when you acquire it and the GM must approve
it. You can take Ultimate Effort multiple times, each time,
it  applies  to  a  different  check. This  advantage  may  not
be  used  after  you’ve  rolled  the  die  to  determine  if  you
succeed.

The following are some potential Ultimate Efforts. The GM
is free to add others suitable to the series.

•

•

•

Ultimate Aim: When  you  take  a  standard  action  to
aim an attack (see Aim, page 246), you can spend a
hero point to apply a 20 result to the attack check on
the following round. Since the Ultimate Aim bonus is
not a natural 20, it also does not qualify as an auto-
matic or critical hit.

Ultimate Resistance: You can spend a hero point to
apply a 20 result to a resistance check with one de-
fense determined when you acquire this advantage.

Ultimate Skill: You can spend a hero point to apply a
20 result to checks with a particular skill.

COMBAT

You are especially attuned to danger. You are not vulnera-
ble when surprised or otherwise caught off-guard. You are
still made vulnerable by effects that limit your mobility.

COMBAT

If you take the defend action (see Defend in the Action
&  Adventure  chapter)  and  successfully  defend  against
a  close  weapon  attack,  you  can  make  a  disarm  attempt
against the attacker immediately as a reaction. The disarm
attempt  is  carried  out  normally,  including  the  attacker
getting the opportunity to disarm you.

COMBAT

If you take the defend action (see Defend in the Action
&  Adventure  chapter)  and  successfully  defend  against
a close weapon attack, you can make an attack against
the attacker’s weapon immediately as a reaction. This re-
quires an attack check and inflicts normal damage to the
weapon if it hits (see Smash in the Action & Adventure
chapter).

WELL-INFORMED

SKILL

You are exceptionally well-informed. When encountering
an individual, group, or organization for the first time, you
can make an immediate Investigation or Persuasion skill
check to see if your character has heard something about
the subject. Use the guidelines for gathering information
in the Investigation skill description to determine the lev-
el of information you gain. You receive only one check per
subject  upon  first  encountering  them,  although  the  GM
may allow another upon encountering the subject again
once significant time has passed.

EXTRAS

Area: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets
in the affected area. You spend only one hero point, but
the subjects are each affected individually. You must ap-
ply the same effect to all subjects at once. +1 cost per rank.

Luck: Each rank in this extra gives you the benefit of a rank
in the Luck advantage (see Luck in the Advantages chap-
ter). It is subject to the same limits as the Luck advantage
set by the GM. Flat +1 point per rank of Luck.

Selective: This extra, applied to Area Luck Control, allows
you to choose who in the area is or is not affected by it. +1
cost per rank.

FLAWS

Action: If the action required for Luck Control is increased
beyond a reaction, it is only usable during your turn each

Effect:  Perception  Ranged  Damage,  Resisted  by  Will  •
4 points per rank

You can strike targets’ minds with “mental force,” inflict-
ing  Damage  resisted  by  the  target’s  Will  rather  than
Toughness, but having no effect on targets immune to
effects resisted by Will, such as inanimate objects. Men-
tal Blasts are often, but not always, Subtle as well, which
costs a flat 1 point.

MAGIC

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You are a sorcerer, witch, or wizard, able to cast a variety
of magical spells. Your basic default effect is a Blast of
eldritch  force,  able  to  inflict  Ranged  Damage  (see  the
Blast power, previously).

However,  like  the  Energy  Control  power,  Magic  can
have a wide range of Alternate Effects, each a separate
spell you have mastered. The possibilities are virtually
limitless, within the bounds of your hero’s descriptors
and  the  Gamemaster’s  approval.  Examples  include
mystic  bindings  (Affliction,  see  the  Snare  version),
dispelling  magical  effects  (Nullify  Magic),  conjuring
clouds of mist or fog (an Area Visual Concealment At-
tack), scrying distant places (Remote Sensing), or slip-
ping  between  the  dimensions  to  appear  elsewhere
(Teleport), to name just a few.

All Magic effects have the “magic” descriptor regardless
of their other descriptors, so a Blast of flames conjured
with magic has both the “magic” and “fire” descriptors,
for example.

Magicians  often  have  a  Power  Loss  complication  (see
Complications  in  The  Basics  chapter):  if  they  are  un-
able to freely speak and gesture to cast their spells, they
cannot  use  Magic  (or  any  related  magical  powers  reli-
ant on spellcasting). Certain styles of Magic may impose

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

The  exception  is  Toughness,  which  can  only  be  increased
above your base Stamina rank using advantages and pow-
ers, not by direct spending of power points. This reflects that
greater-than-normal Toughness is virtually always some sort
of special ability. See the Advantages and Powers chapters
for various options for improving Toughness, notably the De-
fensive Roll advantage and the Protection effect.

Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to
be fully effective. Limits on your mobility, focus, and reac-
tion time adversely affect them. If you are vulnerable, your
Dodge  and  Parry  defense  ranks  are  halved  (divide  their
normal values by 2 and round up), and if you are defense-
less, they are both reduced to 0!

One  use  of  defenses  is  determining  a  defense  class,  or
the  difficulty  class  to  affect  a  target  with  a  particular  at-
tack. This  is  the  appropriate  defense,  plus  10,  just  like  a
routine  check  (indeed,  it  is  essentially  a  measure  of  the
character’s “routine” defense). So hitting a character with
a ranged attack goes against Dodge defense, giving the
attack a DC of (Dodge + 10). Similarly, affecting someone
with a mental power goes against Will defense, with a DC
of (Will + 10), and so forth. This is referred to as “targeting”
a defense, such as “targets Dodge” or “targets Will”.

The main defense class traits are Dodge, Parry, and Will.

Defenses  are  also  used  to  measure  the  ability  to  over-
come certain effects, involving a resistance check of the
defense plus a die roll against a difficulty class determined
by the effect or hazard. So you might make a Fortitude re-
sistance check for your hero to overcome a toxin, for ex-
ample, or a Dodge resistance check to avoid a trap just as
it is triggered, and so on. This is referred to as “resisting,”
such as “resisted by Fortitude” or “resisted by Dodge”.

The  main  resistance  check  traits  are  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, and Will.

When  things  start  happening  quickly,  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
characters use their initiative bonuses to determine
who goes first. Each character involved in a conflict makes
a check of d20 + initiative modifier, which is:

Initiative Modifier = Agility + Advantages
(Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers

Characters then act in initiative order, from highest to low-
est. For details see the Action & Adventure chapter.

Items provided by the Equipment advantage (see the Advantages chapter) are essentially effects and other traits with Easily
Removable, along with the various other limitations outlined in the Gadgets & Gear chapter, amounting to a reduction of
–4 points per 5 power points of final cost. Thus the Equipment advantage provides 5 points worth of equipment per rank
(or 1 power point).

ture  to  find  certain  rare  parts,  specialized  help,  or  other
components.

SENSE-DEPENDENT

-1 COST PER RANK

For a flat 1-point reduction in the value of the Removable
flaw, you can define a device as Indestructible. It can still
be taken away, but cannot be damaged or destroyed, ex-
cept as a GM-imposed complication (earning the player a
hero point as usual). This reduction can lower the value of
the flaw to 0, in which case the character gets no power
point discount for the device.

The temporary loss of a removable power does not con-
stitute  a  complication,  any  more  than  the  result  of  any
other  flaw. You  can  have  a  device  or  power-object  as  a
descriptor without this flaw, if you wish, in which case the
power cannot be removed or taken away from you with-
out a complication applied by the GM (earning you a hero
point) or the use of an effect like Nullify, which has pre-
defined conditions for recovery.

-1 COST PER RANK

When applied to an effect that doesn’t normally allow a
resistance  check,  this  flaw  gives  it  one.  Choose  the  de-
fense when the flaw is applied. Since effects that work on
others  allow  a  resistance  check  by  definition,  this  nearly
always applies to personal effects that allow someone in-
teracting with them to circumvent the effect with a suc-
cessful check.

For  example,  an  Enhanced  Parry  defense  effect  might  re-
flect a low-level reading of a target’s mind to anticipate and
avoid attacks. It allows a Will resistance check to overcome
the effect, denying you the defense bonus against that op-
ponent (and applying this flaw to the effect). Likewise, your
Concealment  effect  might  be  illusory  rather  than  a  true
physical transformation, permitting a Will resistance check
for someone to overcome it. A sustained Protection effect
might be some sort of “kinetic field” that permits an attack-
er a Fortitude resistance check to overcome it.

When applied to an effect that does normally allow a re-
sistance check, this flaw gives it an additional one, which
may be the same as its normal

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

a hero has Agility 6 and is trained in Acrobatics (with a rank
of 7) then the character’s bonus for checks involving feats
of agility covered by Acrobatics is 13 (6 plus 7). Obviously,
training in a skill makes characters more effective at checks
involving that skill, often much more.

For details on what skills are available and what they do,
see the Skills chapter.

Halfway between skills and powers, advantages are minor
benefits characters have, allowing them to do things oth-
ers cannot. They range from special combat maneuvers to
things like financial resources, contacts, and so forth.

Many advantages have no rank, or rather just one rank; a
character either has the advantage (and the benefits that
it grants) or does not. Other advantages may have multiple
ranks, like abilities and skills, measuring their effectiveness.

For details on the various advantages and what they pro-
vide, see the Advantages chapter.

When  using  the  Measurements  Table,  there  are  a  few
important things to keep in mind:

•

•

•

Each rank represents a range of measures. Time
rank  4  is  actually  all  measures  between  1  and  2
minutes, and time rank 16 is everything between 2
and 4 days! So if you’re looking for a measurement
that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one
that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than
8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance
rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).

Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.
In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed
14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds.
You can extend the negative side the Measurement
Table just like you can the positive side, with each
lower  rank  halving  the  previous  measurement.  So
rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3
inches, for example.

Don’t directly add ranks.  Putting  rank  4  distance
together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance!
Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6
is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements,
you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the
ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you
have different ranks, it is best to either handle them
separately  or  convert  them  to  measurements,  add
the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank
7 distance (around half a mile).

•  Measurements  are  approximate.  Especially  at
the higher end, where eac

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS Roleplaying Game allows you to create any sort of hero you want by choosing your character’s
abilities, skills, powers, and other traits. You have a “budget” of power points with which to build your hero. There are
also certain limits and guidelines imposed by the game’s power level, chosen by the Gamemaster, but within those
limits you can build a wide range of characters.

The quickest and easiest way to create your own MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero is to look through the various hero arche-
types on pages 35-49, choose one that fits the type of hero you want to play, and customize it to match your ideas. With
just a few quick choices, you have a new hero, complete and ready for the game!

Each archetype offers a complete, ready-to-play power level 10 hero, the recommended starting power level for MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS. Some archetypes offer a few simple choices in terms of skills, advantages, or sets of powers to fit different
themes. For example, many archetypes offer a choice of an Expertise skill to round out the character’s background and
interests outside of superheroism.

Some archetypes also offer an Options section, where you can change some of the pre-existing trait choices to create a
different kind of hero. For example, the Crime Fighter archetype has options for a hero with less equipment, but super-
human senses, or a special vehicle of some type. Other archetypes offer similar options.

Even if the archetype does not have an Options section that does not mean you cannot customize the archetype to suit
the type of hero you want to play! The archetypes are just starting points: if you are more familiar with character design
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, feel free to change any or all of your chosen archetype’s traits. So long as you stay within the
bounds of available power points, series power level, and your Gamemaster’s approval, you’re fine.

Please note, the characters on pages 35-49 include some Advantages in italicized print. Those advantages are from an
Enhanced Advantage effect listed in their powers.

Designing a hero from scratch in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS follows a series of simple steps, using the information presented
in the other chapters of this book. You’ll need a copy of the character sheet found in the back of the book (and also avail-
able online) and some scratch paper to design your character. If you’re pressed for time, looking for some inspiration,

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES
CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

Heroes are more than just skilled, they often have amazing advantages, beyond the abilities of ordinary people. In MU-
MASTERMINDS, advantages often allow heroes to “break the rules,” gaining access to and doing things most people
cannot, or simply doing them better.

Advantages are rated in ranks and bought with power points, just like abilities and skills. Advantages cost 1 power point
per rank. Some advantages have no ranks and are acquired only once, effectively at rank 1.
Advantage Cost = 1 power point per advantage rank

Each advantage’s description explains the benefit it provides. It also says if the advantage can be acquired in ranks and
the effects of doing so. Such advantages are listed as “Ranked” alongside the advantage name. Ranks in a advantage are
noted with a number after the advantage’s name, such as “Defensive Roll 2” (for a character who has taken two ranks
in the Defensive Roll advantage), just like skill and power ranks. If there is a maximum number of ranks a character can
take, it’s listed in parentheses after the word “Ranked” in the advantage’s heading.

Advantages are categorized as one of four types:

•

•

•

•

Combat  Advantages  are  useful  in  combat  and  of-
ten modify how various combat maneuvers are per-
formed.

Fortune  Advantages  require  and  enhance  the  use
of hero points.

General Advantages provide special abilities or bo-
nuses not covered by the other categories.

Skill Advantages offer bonuses or modifications to
skill use.

Each advantage is listed by name, type, and if the advan-
tage is available in multiple ranks, followed by a descrip-
tion of the advantage’s benefits. The effects of additional
ranks  of  the  advantage  (if  any)  are  noted  in  the  text  of
each advantage. In some cases a advantage’s description
mentions  the  normal  conditions  for  characters  who  do
not have the advantage for comparison.

COMBAT

When you make an accurate attack (see Maneuvers, page
249) you can take a penalty of up to –5 on the effect modi-
fier of the attack and add the same number (up to +5) to
your attack bonus.

SKILL

You can use your Acrobatics bonus or movement speed
rank in place of Deception to feint and trick in combat as if
your skill bonus or speed rank were your Deception bonus
(see the Deception skill description). Your opponent op-
poses the attempt with Acrobatics or Insight (whichever
is better).

LITERACY

Characters are assumed to be literate in their native language and any other language they know. At the GM’s discretion,
characters may have to spend an additional Languages rank to be literate in a language with a different alphabet or style
of writing from the character’s native language (such as Arabic, Japanese kanji or Russian Cyrillic for an English speaker).
Completely illiterate characters are faced with a potential Disability complication during the game.

level limits, like other uses of hero points. Multiple uses of
Inspire do not stack, only the highest bonus applies.

JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES

SKILL

GENERAL

You can go from prone to standing as a free action with-
out the need for an Acrobatics skill check.

INTERPOSE

GENERAL

Once  per  round,  when  an  ally  within  range  of  your  nor-
mal movement is hit by an attack, you can choose to place
yourself between the attacker and your ally as a reaction,
making  you  the  target  of  the  attack  instead. The  attack
hits  you  rather  than  your  ally,  and  you  suffer  the  effects
normally. You cannot use this advantage against area ef-
fects or perception range attacks, only those requiring an
attack check.

INVENTOR

SKILL

You can use the Technology skill to create inventions. See
Inventing, page 211, for details.

You can use any skill untrained, even skills or aspects of
skills  that  normally  cannot  be  used  untrained,  although
you must still have proper tools if the skill requires them.

LANGUAGES

SKILL, RANKED

You  can  speak  and  understand  additional  languages.
With one rank in this advantage, you know an additional
language. For each additional rank, you double your ad-
ditional  known  languages:  two  at  rank  2,  four  at  rank  3,
eight at rank 4, etc. So a character with Languages 7 is flu-
ent in 64 languages! Characters are assumed to be fluent
in any languages they know, including being able to read
and write in them.

For the ability to understand any language, see the Com-
prehend effect in the Powers chapter.

FORTUNE

Your presence reassures and lends courage to your allies.
As  a  standard  action,  you  can  spend  a  hero  point  to  re-

CHAPTER 5: ADVANTAGES

FASCINATE

SKILL, RANKED

COMBAT

One of your interaction skills is so effective you can cap-
ture  and  hold  other’s  attention  with  it.  Choose  Decep-
tion,  Intimidation,  or  Persuasion  when  you  acquire  this
advantage. You can also use Fascinate with an appropri-
ate  Expertise  skill,  like  musician  or  singer,  at  the  GM’s
discretion.

You  are  subject  to  the  normal  guidelines  for  interaction
skills, and combat or other immediate danger makes this
advantage  ineffective. Take  a  standard  action  and  make
an  interaction  skill  check  against  your  target’s  opposing
check (Insight or Will defense). If you succeed, the target is
entranced. You can maintain the effect with a standard ac-
tion each round, giving the target a new resistance check.
The effect ends when you stop performing, the target suc-
cessfully resists, or any immediate danger presents itself.
Like all interaction skills, you can use Fascinate on a group,
but  you  must  affect  everyone  in  the  group  in  the  same
way.

You may take this advantage more than once. Each time, it
applies to a different skill.

FAST GRAB

COMBAT

When  you  hit  with  an  unarmed  attack  you  can  immedi-
ately make a grab check against that opponent as a free
action (see Grab, page 248). Your unarmed attack inflicts
its normal damage and counts as the initial attack check
required to grab your opponent.

COMBAT

You  have  an  environment  you’re  especially  suited  for
fighting  in.  Examples  include  in  the  air,  underwater,  in
space, in extreme heat or cold, in jungles or woodlands,
and so forth. While you are in your favored environment,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack checks or your
active defenses. Choose at the start of the round whether
the bonus applies to attack or defense. The choice remains
until the start of your next round. This circumstance bonus
is not affected by power level.

SKILL

You have a particular type of opponent you’ve studied or
are especially effective against. It may be a type of creature
(aliens, animals, constructs, mutants, undead, etc.), a pro-
fession (soldiers, police officers, Yakuza, etc.) or any other
category  the  GM  approves.  Especially  broad  categories
like “humans” or “villains” are not permitted. You gain a +2
circumstance  bonus  on  Deception,  Intimidation,  Insight,
and Perception checks dealing with your Favored Foe. This
circumstance bonus is not limited by power level.

people are favorable or indifferent toward heroes, but a
specific circumstance or complication may call for a dif-
ferent attitude.

You  can  improve  others’  attitudes  with  a  DC  15  Persua-
sion  check.  Success  improves  the  subject’s  attitude  by
one  step,  while  every  two  additional  degrees  of  success
improve it by another step (so two steps at three degrees,
three  steps  at  five  degrees,  and  so  forth).  Failure  means
no change, and more than a degree of failure worsens the
subject’s attitude by one step! In the case of a hostile sub-
ject, they may outright attack or otherwise interfere with
you if their attitude worsens.

ATTITUDES

ATTITUDE

EFFECT

Hostile

Will take risks to attack
or interfere with you.

Unfavorable

Will insult, mislead,
or otherwise cause you trouble.

Indifferent

Favorable

Helpful

Acts as socially expected
towards you.

Will chat, advise,
and offer limited help.

Will take risks to
help or protect you.

Persuading someone is at least a standard action, usually
quite a bit longer. The GM decides if you can persuade at
all once a conflict has broken out! Even if the initial check
succeeds,  the  other  character  can  only  be  persuaded  so
far;  you  can  try  again  in  the  same  scene,  but  you  check
against the subject’s initial attitude, and may end up wors-
ening it rather than improving it!

Example:  The  heroes  must  convince  the  imperi-
ous King of Atlantis that the surface world is not
responsible  for  recent  attacks  against  his  king-
dom  in  order  to  avert  a  war.  The  king’s  attitude
is  unfavorable  towards  these  surface-world  in-
terlopers  to begin with. The team’s spokesperson
makes  a  Persuasion  attempt  and  gets  a  check
result  of  22,  a  success  with  two  degrees  total.
That  shifts  the  king’s  attitude  one  step,  to  indif-
ferent. He’s inclined to continue negotiating with
the heroes and willing to place the assault on the
surface world on-hold for the time-being. The he-
roes try to convince the king further, but any ad-
ditional checks need at least the same degree of
success as the first to get his attitude to favorable,
where he is willing to call off the attack, and more
than one degree of failure on any check moves his
attitude to hostile, where he orders the intruders
arrested and the attack to begin at once!

evidence appears,

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

tales and scary stories. They’re generally regarded as ur-

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The following archetypes are ready to play for a power level 10 series. Some require a few simple choices or offer options
for customization. Gamemasters can also use these archetypes as ready-made villains, if desired.

The Gadgeteer and Martial Artist rely a great deal on their
advantages (as do other archetypes like the Crime Fighter
and Weapon Master). You’ll want to read the descriptions
of all of the character’s advantages from the Advantages
chapter so you know the benefits they provide. Remem-
ber to make use of them during play to give your charac-
ter every appropriate, well, advantage.

In particular, note how some advantages and even pow-
ers work together. The Gadgeteer can use Quick-Thinking
to speed up the process of inventing (see Inventing, page
211) and Skill Mastery (Technology) to make some invent-
ing  checks  as  routine.  Similarly,  note  the  Martial  Artist’s
Power Attack advantage, good for doing extra damage to
slow, tough, opponents, and the Skill Mastery (Acrobatics)
advantage  for  pulling  off  formidable  (DC  25)  Acrobatics
checks as routine!

The  Mimic  and  Mystic  archetypes  are  both  very  flexible,
although in different ways, and it pays to know what your
character is capable of doing before you are immersed in
the midst of a game.

In the case of the Mimic, the GM may wish to put together
note cards or some other quick reference to the powers of
other characters whom the Mimic might wish to duplicate.
That way, you can see at a glance what traits the character
can copy, and simply hand the card to the player for refer-
ence.  Experienced  Mimics  may  even  build  up  a “hand”  of
such cards they reference often.

For  the  Mystic,  in  addition  to  choosing  your  charac-
ter’s  five  set  Alternate  Effects  (see  Alternate  Effect  on
page  188),  read  the  Magic  sample  power  on  page  168
of the Powers chapter and give some thought to power
stunts your character can do; spur of the moment spells
whipped up to fit a particular need. Mytics are very effec-
tive at power stunts and you might want to reserve a hero
point (or two) for that purpose.

The  Paragon  and  Powerhouse  are  among  the  strongest
archetypes,  able  to  lift  and  carry  a  lot  of  weight.  Just  to
give you an idea, the Paragon can lift a loaded 747 aircraft,
whereas the Powerhouse can lift four times that amount.
Both can easily smash through stone or bend steel.

Both archetypes are pretty tough, to

something else that looks more interesting). This method
combines  the  best  of  the  two  options  above  because  it
limits your choices, but also allows you to control, to some
extent, what you get.

Important note: No matter which option you use when
creating  a  character,  feel  free  to  alter  the  results  of  your
rolls to make sure you get a character you find interesting.
This is not cheating! Simply because these tables are in this
book doesn’t make them “rules” that you have to “follow.”
Instead, consider them play aids with guidelines to make
it easier to create your character…because that’s exactly
what they are.

Every superhero has challenges that make his or her life
more…interesting. Just like the characters in the comics,
your  hero  needs  at least  two  Complications;  one  should
be  a  Motivation  and  the  other  (or  others)  is  up  to  you.
Each Archetype lists a number of suggestions appropriate
for that Archetype. This is your hero, so take the Compli-
cations  that  make  the  most  sense  to  you.  If  none  of  the
suggestions work for you, there are more Complications
to choose from in Chapter 2.

Once you have your character’s various traits and Compli-
cations determined and on paper, you’re ready to play! Your
character should be appropriate for a Power Level 10 (PL10)
game, so you can start playing right away without changes.

It’s  possible,  however,  that  you  have  an  advantage  that
doesn’t mesh correctly with your skills. For example, you
might get the Daze (Intimidation), Skill Mastery (Technol-
ogy),  or  Assessment  advantages,  each  of  which  requires
a  specific  skill  to  work  correctly:  Intimidation,  Technol-
ogy, and Insight, respectively. If that’s the case, feel free to
choose a different advantage, or if you like the effect the
advantage gives you, swap one of your skills for the one
you need. Instances in which this is a problem should be
rare, but they can happen.

Another aspect of “pulling it all together” is making sure
the character is interesting to you. Do this by customizing
your character a bit, if necessary. This is your hero, after all!
Gamemaster, you should work with your players to swap
around a few points’ worth of Abilities, Advantages, Skills,
and/or  Powers  so  they  end  up  with  a  character  more  to
their liking. Usually, this process is as simple as replacing
ranks  of  one  effect  for

The  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  Quickstart  Character  Gen-
erator found on the following pages first appeared as a
booklet  included  with  the  M&M  Gamemaster’s  Kit.  Our
goal in creating it was to make it easier for new players
and  Gamemasters  to  create  characters.  It  proved  very
popular and when we had the chance, we offered up the
idea  of  including  an  updated  version  of  it  in  the  Hero’s
Handbook to the fans and their response was a resound-
ing, “Yes!”

This updated version of the Quickstart Character Genera-
tor includes clearer instructions, some new powers and
options for some of the archetypes, and fixes to a couple
of the archetypes to make sure they didn’t break any of
the rules.

HEROES

The  character  generator  allows  players  to  quickly  create
power level 10 starting characters. Using these tables, new
players can start playing their new hero in mere minutes.
All they need to do is roll a d20 to find out what Archetype
they  get,  then  roll  on  the  tables  for  that  Archetype  and
write  everything  down  on  a  character  sheet  or  piece  of
paper and they’re set!

Sure, this method removes a lot of choice from the pro-
cess,  but  that  speeds  up  character  creation,  since  the
player doesn’t have to make every single decision along
the way (or even know the rules!). It can also provide some
much-needed inspiration to a player who doesn’t have a
strong idea for a new hero. Experienced players may not
need to randomly generate characters, but they may still
want to. The results from the random tables can be inter-
esting in ways a carefully conceived and planned charac-
ter is not.

Finally,  the  Gamemaster  can  use  these  tables  to  quickly
come up with a villain or NPC hero. Randomly roll a char-
acter or pick the Archetype and powers that best fit the
needs  of  the  story  and  within  moments  the  character  is
ready to go!

No  matter  how  Gamemasters  and  players  end  up  using
the Quickstart Character Generator, it should make starting
a game easier, faster, and more fun.

There are a few different ways to use the character gen-
erator.  Gamemasters  and  players  should  agree  on  the
method  they’re  using  before  beginning,  and  work  with
each  other  during  the  process  to  make  sure  the  end  re-
sult is agreeable. After all, you’re here to have fun, so your
main goal should be to ma

goes off. For every two full degrees of success, the explo-
sive deals +5 damage to the structure. Failure means the
explosive does not go off as planned, while more than one
degree of failure means the charge goes off while you are
setting it! In all cases, the explosive deals normal damage
to all other targets.

You  can  make  an  explosive  device  more  difficult  to  dis-
arm. To do so, choose a disarm difficulty class before mak-
ing  your  check  to  set  the  detonator. Your  DC  to  set  the
detonator  is  the  desired  disarm  DC.  Failure  means  the
explosive fails to go off as planned. Two or more degrees
of failure mean the explosive goes off as the detonator is
being installed!

Disarming an explosive also requires a Technology check.
The DC is usually 10, unless the person who set the deto-
nator chose a higher disarm DC (previously). If you fail the
check, you do not disarm the explosive. With more than a
degree of failure, the explosive goes off. Setting or disarm-
ing a detonator is a standard action.
INVENTING

If you have the Inventor advantage (see the Advantages
chapter),  you  can  use  Technology  to  create  inventions,
temporary devices. See Inventing, page 211, for details.

SECURITY

You  can  use  Technology  to  disarm  or  sabotage  various
security devices, including locks, traps, and sensors. This
takes  at  least  a  minute,  possibly  longer,  at  the  GM’s  dis-
cretion.  The  GM  makes  your  Technology  check  secretly
so you don’t necessarily know right away if you have suc-
ceeded. The Gamemaster sets the DC of the check based
on the level of security:

Simple lock or home alarm system

Quality lock or home alarm system

Business and corporate security

High security: branch bank vault, museum

Very high security: bank headquarters
vault, medium prison

Maximum security: highly secure prison

Super-max security: super-prison

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Consider  the  effects  of  age  on  your  hero.  Someone  who
fought  in  the  Second World War  is  likely  to  have  a  differ-
ent worldview than a modern teenager who just acquired
super-powers, to say nothing of an immortal who has seen
civilizations rise and fall or a godlike being from the dawn of
time. A character’s age may influence the choice of certain
traits. Aged characters are likely to have lower physical abil-
ity ranks, for example, while younger ones may have fewer
skill ranks (having had less time to train in various skills).

What  does  your  hero  look  like?  Consider  things  like  the
character’s  race,  sex,  ethnicity,  and  other  factors  in  ap-
pearance.  Is  the  hero  even  human?  Superheroes  can  be
aliens,  robots,  androids,  spirits,  and  beings  of  pure  en-
ergy.  Is  the  character  short  or  tall? What  about  hair  and
eye color? Does the hero have any distinguishing marks
or unique features; is his appearance unusual in any way
(apart from running around in a costume, that is)? Does
the  hero  qualify  for  the  Attractive  advantage?  (See  the
Advantages  chapter  for  details.)  What  about  complica-
tions stemming from the hero’s looks?
COSTUME

A costume is a big part of a superhero’s appearance. Like
code  names,  most  heroes  have  a  distinctive  costume,
usually  something  skin-tight  and  colorful,  often  embla-
zoned  with  a  symbol  or  logo.  Other  heroes  wear  more
military-style outfits, fatigues or body armor with numer-
ous bandoliers and belts. A suit of armor may serve as the
hero’s costume: anything from ancient mail to a high-tech

battlesuit. A few heroes don’t wear a special costume, just
ordinary street clothes (which in itself can be pretty dis-
tinctive among a group of spandex-clad heroes).

In the comics, costumes are generally immune to the kind
of  routine  wear-and-tear  a  hero’s  powers  should  inflict
on them. For example, heroes who can burst into flames
don’t usually incinerate their clothing. The same is true for
heroes who change their size or shape. Although a hero’s
costume can be damaged or torn by attacks and other cir-
cumstances, it’s usually immune to the hero’s powers. This
doesn’t cost any points; it’s just the way costumes work.
For more on costumes as equipment, see the Gadgets &
Gear chapter.

Although heroes spend a lot of time fighting crime and us-
ing their powers to help others, most also try to find time

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

This maneuver does not apply to effects requiring no at-
tack check or allowing no resistance check.

When you make an attack, you can take a penalty of up to
–2 on the effect modifier of the attack and add the same
number (up to +2) to your attack bonus. Your effect modi-

cannot more than double in this way. The changes are de-

You can use Intimidation in combat as a standard action
to undermine an opponent’s confidence. Make an Intimi-
dation check as a standard action opposed by the better

check succeeds, your target is impaired (a –2 circumstance
penalty on checks) until the end of your next round. With
four or more degrees of success, the target is disabled (a
–5 penalty) until the end of your next round.

FEINT

You can use Deception as a standard action to mislead an
opponent in combat. Make a Deception check as a stan-
dard action opposed by the better of your target’s Decep-

is designed to emulate the superhero comic books, so characters generally bounce back pretty fast
from taking serious beatings, and there is little differentiation between getting punched through a brick wall and shot-up
with a .45 caliber (or, for that matter, set on fire or electrocuted). Realistically, any or all of these things should result in
severe injuries that take a considerable amount of time to heal; in the comics, most characters just shake it off and are all
better by the next scene.

If you want to include lasting or more serious injuries in your game, or just in a particular story, they are better handled
as complications (see the Complications section in The Basics chapter for details). This is largely how the comics handle
them; most of the time, heroes bounce back from the effects of combat but, occasionally, a character suffers a serious and
significant injury—such as a broken arm or head trauma—that plays a role in the story later on. Handle this like any other
GM-imposed complication: award the player a hero point when it comes into play, and apply the effects of the complication
to the story. Use the conditions defined in The Basics chapter as an idea of the complications facing an injured character.

DEATH

Character death is a relatively rare happenstance in the comic books. Technically, it’s not so much rare as it is temporary. The
tendency of comic book characters to return from the dead has become so commonplace it is cliché, with various stories
and characters poking fun at it.

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS rules make character death a similarly rare occurrence. Characters generally only acquire the dying
condition after being incapacitated and suffering further harm, which usually means someone is actively trying to kill them.
Even then, dying characters have opportunities to stabilize and stave off death. It takes a second active effort to kill a dying
character outright, so accidental death due to a single bad die roll is all but impossible for the major characters in a series.

Note that none of this applies to minions, who can be killed simply with a successful attack and a declaration of intent to
do so. While heroes in a four-color or mainstream style game generally refrain from killing, minions can get mowed down
by the dozens in gritty Iron Age style games. The Gamemaster can also kill off supporting characters as desired to suit t

stow a weapon or other object, stand up, pick up an ob-
ject, or perform some equivalent action (see the Actions
in Combat Table).

You can take a move action in place of a standard action.
For example, rather than moving your speed and attack-
ing  you  can  stand  up  and  move  your  speed  (two  move
actions),  draw  a  weapon  and  climb  (two  move  actions),
or pick up an object and stow it (two move actions). You
can also make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to
run faster: one or more degree of success increases your
ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

Free actions consume very little time and, over the span of
the round, their impact is so minor they are considered to
take no real time at all. You can perform one or more free
actions  while  taking  another  action.  For  instance,  drop-
ping an object, dropping to a prone position, speaking a
sentence or two, and ceasing to concentrate on maintain-
ing a power are all free actions.

REACTION

A  reaction  is  something  that  happens  in  response  to
something  else,  like  a  reflex.  Like  free  actions,  reactions
take so little time they’re considered free. The difference
between  the  two  is  a  free  action  is  a  conscious  choice
made  on  the  character’s  turn  to  act.  A  reaction  can  oc-
cur even when it’s not your turn to act. Some powers and
other traits are usable as reactions.

NO ACTION

Finally,  some  things  players  are  called  upon  to  do—cer-
tain die rolls like resistance checks, for example—are not
considered actions at all, as they involve no action on the
part of the characters.

When  it  is  your  turn  in  the  initiative  order,  you  declare
what actions your character will perform, and they are re-
solved in order.

The Gamemaster informs you when it is your turn. When
you start your turn, you should:

•

End  effects that last “until the start of your next turn”.

You get a standard and a move action each turn. You can
exchange your standard action for an additional move ac-
tion, allowing you to perform two move actions. You can
also perform as many free actions on your turn as you wish.

You perform your actions in any order that you wish, but
you cannot normally “split” your actions. So, for example, al-

though you can move (move action) and then attack (stan-
dard  action)  or  attack  and  then  move,  you  cannot  move
half  your  distance,  attack,  and  then  move  the  other  half
unless you have some special trait that allows you to do so.

At the end of your turn, you should:

•

End any effects that last “until the end of your turn”.

•  Make  any  necessary  resistance  checks  to  recover

You  can  use  extra  effort  in  order  to  take  an  additional
standard or move action on your turn (see Extra Effort on
page 19).

•

from ongoing effects.

Inform the Gamemaster and other players that your
turn is finished, allowing the next character in the ini-
tiative order to go.

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game terms, a challenge is an action or series of actions where players are called upon to make
checks of their characters’ traits, but which do not involve direct conflict, such as fighting. Some challenges are quick
and involve only a single character, such as a hero making a daring leap or acrobatic maneuver, while others are more
involved and require the efforts of a whole team, such as clearing all of the people out of a burning building or search-
ing the entire city (or world!) for an escaped criminal.

The challenges given in this section are by no means the only possible ones. They simply cover the major “building
blocks” Gamemasters can use to create challenges in their own games and offer examples. Feel free to come up with
your own challenges to test the heroes’ abilities and give the players an opportunity to come up with clever plans of
their own.

Challenges may or may not involve initiative checks, de-
pending on the nature of the challenge.

If all of the characters get a turn and it does not particu-
larly matter who goes first, then the Gamemaster can dis-
pense with initiative for the challenge. For example, if the
heroes  all  have  to  leap  across  a  chasm,  then  it  is  a  chal-
lenge they must all complete, and it does not particularly
matter which of them goes first or last in doing so (since
their actions are all virtually simultaneous).

With other challenges, it does matter who goes first, par-
ticular when the challenge is timed in some fashion. So,
for example, if the GM determines that part of a burning
building will collapse after the first round, initiative may
be  checked  to  see  which  heroes  go  before  the  collapse

means your attack hits automatically, since the target has
no defense bonus, and the routine check overcomes the
normal difficulty.

If  you  choose  to  make  your  attack  check  normally
(against DC 10), then a successful hit is treated as a criti-
cal hit, with a +5 circumstance bonus to the attack’s re-
sistance DC. Additionally, if you hit with a damaging at-
tack with intent to kill, and the target’s resistance check
has three or more degrees of failure, the target dies im-
mediately.

When you make an attack you can take a penalty of up to
–2 on your attack bonus and add the same number (up to
+2) to the effect bonus of your attack. Your attack bonus
cannot  be  reduced  below  +0  and  the  effect  bonus  can-
not more than double. The changes to attack and effect
are  decided  before you  make  your  attack  check  and  last
until the start of your next turn. This maneuver does not
apply to effects requiring no attack check or allowing no
resistance check.

When you charge, you can charge right into your target,
using  your  momentum  to  strengthen  your  attack,  but
potentially receiving some damage from the impact your-
self. The damage rank for your attack equals your move-

ment  speed  rank,  or  your  normal  damage  rank,  with  a
+1 circumstance bonus, whichever is higher. If you move
your full speed before you charge, increase your damage
by either means by an additional +1 circumstance bonus.
The Gamemaster may limit your base slam attack damage
(before  applying  circumstance  modifiers)  by  the  series
power level.

Example:  Slingshot  flies  into  a  foe,  moving  at
speed  rank  10.  His  unarmed  damage  (Strength)
rank is only 2, so he uses his speed rank of 10 for the
damage. Since he also moved his full speed to build
up momentum, he increases his damage by +1 for
a total damage rank of 11. If a base damage rank
of 10 is too high for the series, the GM may impose
a  lower  limit  on  Slingshot’s  slam  attack  damage,
applying the +1 modifier for the full speed move to
the lowered rank.

You suffer some of the impact of slamming into a target;
make a Toughness resistance check against half the dam-
age rank of your attack (rounded down).

Example: Slingshot hits his target, and must make
his own Toughness resistance check against dam-
age rank 5: his slam attack damage of 11, divided
by 2, which equals 5.5, rounded down to 5. Fortu-
nately,  Slingshot’s  helmet  provides  him  with  an

ing  Damage  resisted  by  Fortitude.  At  the  GM’s  discre-
tion,  radiation  exposure  can  lead  to  other  effects,  such
as damage to a hero’s power ranks (causing a temporary
decrease in powers).
VACUUM

The primary hazards of the vacuum of space are lack of air
and exposure to unfiltered ionizing radiation.

On  the  third  round  of  exposure  to  vacuum,  a  character
must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  20)  each  round
or suffer from aeroembolism (“the bends”). A failed check
means excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in the
creature’s  bloodstream;  the  creature  is  stunned  and  re-
mains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure.
Two or more degrees of failure impose the incapacitated
condition.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though
holding one’s breath in vacuum damages the lungs. A char-
acter who attempts to hold his breath must make a Forti-
tude check (DC 15) every round; the DC increases by 1 each
round, and on a successful check the character loses a rank
of Stamina (from the pressure on the linings of his lungs). If
the check fails, or when the character simply stops holding
his breath, he begins to suffocate: the next round, he be-
comes incapacitated . The following round, he’s dying and
cannot stabilize until returned to a normal atmosphere.

Unfiltered  radiation  bombards  any  character  trapped  in
the vacuum of space without protective gear, see Radia-
tion, previously.

Heroes able to ignore the effects of deep space must have
Immunity to suffocation, vacuum, and radiation, at a mini-
mum. See the Immunity effect in the Powers chapter for
details.

CONFLICTS

A conflict is when two or more characters go up against each other, typically in a fight of some sort. Conflict between
heroes and villains is a prime part of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS and a big element of the fun, just like the colorful and spec-
tacular fights in the superhero comic books.

ATTACKS

An attack check represents an attempt to hit a target with
an attack. When you make an attack check, roll the die and
add your bonus with that attack. If your result equals or
exceeds  the  target’s  defense,  your  attack  hits  and  may
have some effect.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus vs.
defense class

When you make an attack check and get a natural 20 (the
d20 actually shows 20), you automatically hit, regardless
of  your  target’s  defense,  and  you  score  a  threat. The  hit
might also

DAMAGE

A successful attack with a Damage effect requires the tar-
get to make a Toughness resistance check.

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage,  the  target’s  condition  shifts  to  dying.  A  dying
target  who  fails  a  resistance  check  against  Damage  is
dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability
to hit things! You can apply effect modifiers to the Dam-
age your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even
an  Area  effect!  You  can  also  have  Alternate  Effects  for
your Strength Damage; see the Alternate Effect modi-
fier  for  details.  Like  other  Damage  effects,  a  character’s
Strength Damage is close range and instant duration by
default.

If you choose, a Damage effect can be Strength-based—
something like a melee weapon—allowing your Strength
Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and Damage
ranks together when determining the rank of the attack.
Any modifiers applied to your Damage must also apply to
your Strength rank if its bonus damage is to benefit from
them.  However,  any  decrease  in  your  Strength  reduces
the amount you can add to your Damage, and negative
Strength  subtracts  from  your  Damage!  Likewise,  any-
thing that prevents you from exerting your Strength also
stops you from using a Strength-based Damage effect. If
you can’t swing your fist, you can’t swing a sword, either.

less than ideal conditions. This section details some of the
hazards heroes may face.

FALLING

Criminals  often  lurk  in  the  darkness,  and  many  crimes
take  place  at  night.  Most  cities  are  lit  well  enough,  but
sometimes  heroes  run  into  areas  where  it’s  difficult  to
see. Poorly lit areas provide concealment. Characters with
Counters Concealment (Darkness) Senses or other appro-
priate Senses effects can ignore concealment penalties for
poor lighting.

Intense  heat  and  cold  wear  down  characters,  while  pro-
longed exposure to the elements can be extremely dan-
gerous.

Characters in hot or cold conditions must make Fortitude
checks (DC 10, +1 per previous check) to avoid becoming
fatigued.  Fatigued  characters  who  fail  a  check  become
exhausted, then incapacitated, at which point the charac-
ter’s condition becomes dying after another failed Forti-
tude check.

How  often  characters  have  to  make  Fortitude  checks  de-
pends on the conditions. Once an hour for uncomfortable
heat or cold (a hot summer day or cold winter day), once
per 10 minutes for intense heat or cold (a blazing desert or
arctic conditions), once a minute for extreme heat or cold
like the edge of a volcano or an arctic winter storm. Checks
are made at the end of each period of exposure. Truly in-
tense heat or cold—such as a blast furnace or touching liq-
uid nitrogen—inflicts direct damage like an attack.

Characters with the appropriate Immunity do not need to
make Fortitude checks for extreme temperatures.

Heroes  can  go  without  water  for  a  day.  After  this,  they
need to make a Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous
check) each hour to avoid a level of fatigue. Heroes can go
without food for three days. After this, they must make a
Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each day
to  avoid  fatigue.  The  character  cannot  recover  until  he
gets  water  or  food.  Heroes  with  Immunity  to  Starvation
can go an unlimited time without food or water.

Characters can hold their breath for ten rounds (one min-
ute) plus a number of rounds equal to twice their Stamina.
After that time they must make a Fortitude check (DC 10)
each round to continue holding their breath. The DC in-
creases  by  +1  for  each  previous  success.  Failure  on  the
Fortitude  check  means  the  character  becomes  incapaci-
tated . On the following round the character is dying. A dy-
ing character cannot stabilize until

Now the remaining smugglers get to go. They draw their guns and shoot at you!

The GM rolls attack checks against the heroes. Two smugglers shoot at Ultramarine and three shoot at Princess, but they both
have Impervious Toughness 8. Since the smugglers’ guns can’t hurt them, the GM does not bother rolling the attack checks. The
remaining two shoot at Rook, but one is impaired and the other blind, so they both miss by a mile.

Rook, you easily avoid the clumsy shots, especially from the guys dazzled by the flash bomb. Princess, Ultramarine, a
couple of stray shots ricochet off of you harmlessly.
ROUND 2

That brings us back to the top of the order. Princess?

Princess: I’m going to punch-out one of the smugglers! “Hey, watch the couture, boys!”

GM: Roll an unarmed attack check.

Princess: Rolls, gets a natural 20. A critical hit!

GM: Glances at Princess’ Strength of 12, and the +5 critical hit DC modifier, making the Toughness resistance DC (15 + 12 + 5)
or 32. No way the smuggler can succeed.

Wow! You send the guy flying right off the deck and into the drink! Sploosh!

Then, suddenly…

The GM rolls an attack check against Princess, getting a 15 result. Normally this would miss her Dodge defense of 18, but this is
a surprise attack, so Princess is vulnerable and her Dodge is halved to 4, rather than 8, making the DC a 14.

…a steel mesh net launches out of the doorway of the control cabin of the ship. Princess, give me a Dodge resistance
check.

Princess: Rolls a 5 for a total of 13. Um… 13?

GM: Compares it against the DC of 19. Two degrees of failure.

…the net wraps around you tightly, leaving you immobilized and defenseless, Princess.

From out of the control cabin lumbers a massive armored figure in red and silver, one arm ending in a lobster-like servo-
claw.

Ultramarine: Trawler!

GM: In Trawler’s voice. Who did you think was running this operation, heroes? Now back off!

Ultramarine: Is it my turn?

glers.

ground  speed  minus  one  rank,  if  you  choose.  If  you  fail,
you are still grabbed.

GRAB

You  attempt  to  grab  a  target.  Make  an  attack  check
against the target. If successful, the target makes a resis-
tance check against your Strength (or the rank of a grab-
bing effect) using the better of Strength or Dodge. If you
win with one degree of success, the target is restrained
(immobile  and  vulnerable). Two  or  more  degrees  leave
your  opponent  bound  (defenseless,  immobile,  and  im-
paired).  You  can  attempt  to  improve  an  existing  hold
with another grab action on a following turn. Any result-
ing  degrees  of  success  are  cumulative,  but  if  you  lose,
the target escapes.

You  are  hindered  and  vulnerable  while  grabbing  and
holding an opponent. You can maintain a successful grab
as a free action each turn, but cannot perform other ac-
tions requiring the use of your grabbing limb(s) while do-
ing so. Since maintaining a grab is a free action, you can
take a standard action to inflict your Strength damage to
a grabbed target on subsequent turns after the grab is es-
tablished.

You can drag a restrained or bound target along with you
when  you  move.  The  target  gets  a  Strength  resistance
check  against  your  Strength.  If  it  fails,  you  move  and  the
target moves along with you. If the target resists, you are
immobilized that turn unless you release your hold on the
target.

You can end a grab (releasing your target) as a free action.
If you are unable to take the free action maintain the hold,
the target is automatically released. A target can attempt
to escape from a grab as a move action (see Escape).

MOVE

You can move up to your normal speed rank in any move-
ment mode available to you as a move action. Normally
this is rank 0 ground speed for most people (up to 30 feet).
If  you  choose  to  move  twice  on  your  turn  (taking  two
move actions) then you move your speed rank each time.
You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as a free action to
run faster: one or more degree of success increases your
ground speed rank by +1 for one round.

READY

Readying lets you prepare to take an action later, after you
would normally act on your initiative, but before your ini-
tiative on your next turn. Readying is a standard action, so
you can move as well.

If you come to your next turn and have not yet performed
your readied action, you don’t get to take the readied ac-
tion, y

any attack made on you until the start of your next turn.
Add  10  to  any  roll  of  10  or  less  that  you  make  on  these
checks, just as if you spent a hero point (thus ensuring a
minimum  roll  of  11). The  attacker  must  equal  or  exceed
your opposed check result in order to hit you.

DELAY

NO ACTION

When you delay, you choose to take your turn later in the
initiative order. You must delay your entire turn. You can-
not delay if you have already taken an action on your turn,
or if you are unable to take actions.

At any point after any other character in the conflict has
acted,  you  can  choose  to  take  your  turn.  Your  initiative
moves into the new place in the order where you act, and
you take your normal allocation of actions. If you do not
act before your initiative comes up in the next round, your
turn ends, you lose your delayed turn, and your initiative
remains where it is.

Beneficial effects lasting until the end of your turn end
when you choose to delay, but harmful effects that last
until  the  end  of  your  turn  last  until  after  you  act.  Like-
wise, you do not make resistance checks until after you
have taken your turn, so delaying can draw out some ef-
fects.

DISARM

You attempt to knock an item—such as a weapon or de-
vice—out of an opponent’s grasp. Make an attack check

against the defender with a –2 penalty. If you attempt to
disarm with a ranged attack, you are at –5 penalty. If your
attack succeeds, make an opposed check of your attack’s
damage  against  the  defender’s  Strength.  If  you  win,  the
defender dropped the held object. If you made the disarm
unarmed, you can grab the dropped object as a free ac-
tion. If you make a disarm attempt with a melee weapon
and lose the opposed check, the defender may immedi-
ately make an attempt to disarm you as a reaction; make
another opposed damage vs. Strength check. If this dis-
arm attempt fails, you do not, however, get an additional
attempt to disarm the defender.

Dropping a held item is a free action (although dropping
or  throwing  an  item  with  the  intention  of  hitting  some-
thing with it is a standard attack action).

Dropping  to  a  prone  position  is  a  free  action,  although
getting up requires a move action (see Stand).

You attempt to escape from a successful grab (see Grab).

Three heroes: Princess, Rook, (see pages 50-53) and Ultramarine (a battlesuit wearer), tipped-off by one of Rook’s contacts
about smugglers unloading a shipment down at the docks late at night, have staked-out the vessel. Once they see the
smugglers moving the goods, Rook signals it is time to move in and take them down!

ROUND 1

Gamemaster (GM): Okay, everyone, make an initiative check.

The players of Princess, Rook, and Ultramarine each roll the die, adding their character’s initiative modifier and getting the fol-
lowing results: Ultramarine: 13, Rook: 11, Princess: 26!

The GM rolls one initiative check for the smugglers (with an initiative modifier of +0), getting a result of 11. Although Rook has
the same result, he has a higher initiative modifier (+5) and so will go before the smugglers. The GM also rolls a secret initiative
check result of 16 for something the players don’t know yet...

GM: Okay, you get the “go” signal from Rook and leap into action! (Looking at the initiative count) Princess, what do you
do?

Princess: I jump from the pier onto the deck of the ship as my move action, landing right in front of all the smugglers
and say, “You guys want to just give up now and save yourselves a beating? Please feel free to say no.” Then I give them a
big smile.

GM: You want to try and intimidate them? That’s a standard action. You want to make it a routine check?

Princess: No, I’ll roll for it. Princess’ player rolls an Intimidation check with her bonus of +6. I got a 16 anyway, same as my
routine check result!.

The GM compares Princess’ result to the smugglers’ Will defense, which is 12. Her check succeeded with one degree. The smug-
glers are impaired (–2 on their checks) until the end of Princess’ next turn.

GM: The smugglers look shocked at your sudden appearance and hesitate, clearly shaken. Ultramarine, it’s your turn.

Ultramarine: Like shooting fish in a barrel… I surge up out of the water on the other side of the ship and fly up to the
deck (move action) then level the arm with my netline primed at the smugglers, my voice amplified by the speakers in my
suit. “Or you can call it quits right now.”

GM: You going for the Intimidation check, too?

Ultramarine: No, I think I’d rather ready an attack with my netline, if any of the smugglers decide to get stupid, then wait
to see what happens. That’s a standard action, right

NO COVER

COVER

Targets may also hide behind obstructions to gain cover
against your attacks. Obstructions that do not physically
block  attacks  but  simply  make  the  target  harder  to  per-
ceive—such as lighting, fog, or foliage—provide conceal-
ment rather than cover.

Partial Cover applies a –2 circumstance penalty to your
attack check. It generally means about half of the target
is behind cover, such as around a corner, behind a tree or
pillar, or a low wall.

Total  Cover  applies  a  –5  circumstance  penalty  to  your  at-
tack check, with three-quarters or more of the target behind
cover, like a narrow window, or crouched behind a wall.

Damage  resistance  check,  for  example,  is  incapaci-
tated, regardless of the degree of failure.

•

Certain  traits  (like  the  Takedown  advantage)  are
more effective against or specifically target minions.

DEFENSES

Your defenses determine how difficult it is to hit you with
various attacks. Most attacks target your active defenses,
Dodge and Parry: close attacks target Parry while ranged
attacks target Dodge.

You  add  your  defense  rank  to  a  base  value  of  10  (like  a
routine  check)  to  determine  your  defense  class  against
an attack, which is the DC of the attack check:

If a target is completely behind cover, then you cannot at-
tack that target (although you can attack the cover itself ).

Defense Class = defense + 10

Cover  also  grants  a  circumstance  bonus  to  Dodge  resis-
tance  checks  against  area  effects  equal  to  its  penalty  to
attack checks, so long as the target has cover with respect
to the origin point of the effect. So someone behind total
cover also gains a +5 to Dodge checks against area effects.

MINIONS

Minions  are  minor  characters  subject  to  special  rules  in
combat, and generally easier to defeat than normal char-
acters.  Villains  often  employ  hordes  of  minions  against
heroes. The following rules apply to minions:

•  Minions  cannot  score  critical  hits  against  non-min-

ions.

•

•

Non-minions  can  make  attack  checks  against  min-
ions as routine checks.

 If a minion fails a resistance check, the minion suffers
the worst degree of the effect. So a minion failing a

So a hero with Parry 11 has a defense class of 21 (11 + 10)
against close attacks. If the same hero has Dodge 9, that is
a defense class of 19 (9 + 10) against ranged attack

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

A successful attack has some effect on the target. Typical-
ly this is an effect from the Powers chapter, such as Dam-
age or Affliction. The effect has a rank, used to determine
a difficulty class for the target’s resistance check.

Resistance Difficulty = effect rank + 10

The target of the attack makes a resistance check against
the effect to determine what, if anything, happens.

Some  effects  are  not  resisted  just  once,  but  multiples
times. The later resistance checks represent how fast the
target is able to “shake off” the effect. Make a resistance
check  for  the  target  of  an  ongoing  effect  at  the  end  of
each  of  the  target’s  turns.  A  successful  check  ends  the
effect  and  removes  conditions  imposed  by  it.  A  failure
means  the  effect’s  conditions  persist,  as  given  in  the  ef-
fect’s description.

Example: Captain Thunder was hit by a Affliction
effect, leaving him blinded. At the end of his turn,
he makes a Fortitude resistance check against the
effect’s  DC  to  try  and  shake  it  off,  but  missed  the
check  by  2.  His  next  turn,  still  blind,  he  stumbles
and tries to strike the foe taunting him. At the end
of his turn, he makes another resistance check. Suc-
cess! He ends the Affliction effect and removes the
blinded condition. Next turn, the villain had better
watch out!

A  failed  resistance  check  against  an  attack  imposes  one
or more conditions on the target, depending on the type
of effect and the degree of failure. See the effect descrip-
tion and the Conditions section of The Basics chapter for
more on the various conditions.

ACTIONS

The  most  common  actions  characters  take  during  con-
flicts  are  listed  and  described  here.  The  GM  should  use
these as guidelines for dealing with unusual actions play-
ers may choose for their characters, basing them on the
existing action descriptions.

AID

If you are in position to attack an opponent, you can at-
tempt to aid an ally engaged in melee with that oppo-
nent as a standard action. This is like a team check (see
Team  Checks  in  The  Basics  chapter): You  make  an  at-
tack check against DC 10. If you succeed, you don’t actu-
ally hit or affect the opponent, but success grants your
ally  gains  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on  an  attack  check
against  that  opponent  or  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  to

Defense  against  that  opponent  (your  choice)  until  the
end  of  your  ally’s  next
