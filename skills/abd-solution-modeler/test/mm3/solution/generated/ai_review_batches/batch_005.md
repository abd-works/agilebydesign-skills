move  one  of  the  following  conditions  from  an  ally  with
whom you can interact: dazed, fatigued, or stunned.

LUCK

FORTUNE, RANKED (1/2 PL)

Once per round, you can choose to re-roll a die roll, like
spending a hero point (see Hero Points, page 20), includ-
ing adding 10 to re-rolls of 10 or less. You can do this a
number  of  times  per  game  session  equal  to  your  Luck
rank, with a maximum rank of half the series power level
(rounded down). Your Luck ranks refresh when your hero
points “reset”  at  the  start  of  an  adventure. The  GM  may
choose to set a different limit on ranks in this advantage,
depending on the series.

Generally speaking, languages are not terribly important
in comic book superhero stories except as background col-
or or occasional plot complications. Gamemasters should
allow  players  with  characters  fluent  in  other  languages
the occasional opportunity to show them off or put them
to good use. If you specifically set up the language barrier
as an obstacle by confronting the heroes with a language
they cannot possibly understand, that should count as a
complication and be worth a hero point.

COMBAT

MINION

GENERAL, RANKED

You can draw a weapon from a holster or sheath as a free
action, rather than a move action.

You have a follower or minion. This minion is an indepen-
dent  character  with  a  power  point  total  of  (advantage
rank x 15). Minions are subject to the normal power level
limits, and cannot have minions themselves. Your minions
(if capable of independent thought) automatically have a
helpful attitude toward you. They are subject to the nor-
mal rules for minions (see page 245).

Minions do not earn power points. Instead, you must spend
earned  power  points  to  increase  your  rank  in  this  advan-
tage to improve the minion’s power point total and traits.
Minions also do not have hero points. Any lost minions are
replaced in between adventures with other followers with
similar abilities at the Gamemaster’s discretion.

ACTION

COMBAT

When taking a standard action and a move action you can
move both before and after your standard action, provid-
ed the total distance moved isn’t greater than your normal
movement speed.

COMBAT

When  you  make  a  power  attack  (see  Maneuvers,  page
250)  you  can  take  a  penalty  of  up  to  –5  on  your  attack
bonus and add the same number (up to +5) to the effect
bonus of your attack.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

49

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

143

In  some  settings,  the  Gamemaster  may  require  certain
descriptors  for  all  powers.  Usually,  a  required  descrip-
tor reflects some common element of the series. For ex-
ample, if all characters with powers are mutants, then all
powers  have  the “mutant”  descriptor  by  definition,  un-
less  the  player  comes  up  with  a  good  explanation  why
they should not. If all superhumans are psychic mutants,
then  all  powers  have  both  the  “psychic”  and  “mutant”
descriptors. The GM sets the rules as far as what descrip-
tors are required (or restricted) in the series. A character
who breaks this guideline—say the one alien in a setting
where all powers are otherwise mutant in origin—might
have a Benefit (unusual origin) or face certain complica-
tions, possibly both.

Effects with a duration of instant, concentration, or sustained
must be noticeable in some way. For example, a Blast effect
might  have  a  visible  beam  or  make  a  loud  noise  (ZAP!)  or
both. Some effects are quite obvious, such as Flight, Insub-
stantiality, Growth, or Shrinking. Effects with a continuous or
permanent duration are not noticeable by default.

If an instant, concentration, or sustained effect’s base dura-
tion is changed using modifiers, the effect remains notice-
able. A continuous or permanent effect made instant, con-
centration, or sustained also becomes noticeable. The Subtle
modifier (see page 196) can make noticeable powers difficult
or impossible to detect. Conversely, the Noticeable modifier
(see page 200) makes a normally subtle effect noticeable.

Allegiances:  Anarchy,  Balance,  Chaos,  Evil,  Good,  Jus-
tice, Law, Liberty, Tyranny

“Powers” in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS refer to all extraordinary
traits other than abilities, skills, and advantages. Whether a
character  with  powers  is “superhuman”  or  not  is  largely  a
matter of opinion and the descriptors used. For example,
there are lots of comic book characters with superhuman
traits  still  considered “normal”

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

TRANSFORM

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2-5 points per rank

You can change objects into other objects, altering their
shape  or  material  composition  in  the  process. You  must
touch  the  chosen  object,  which  requires  a  close  attack
check if the object is held or worn by another character.

What you can transform affects cost per rank:

•

2 points: Transform one thing or substance into one
other thing or substance, such as metal into wood,
iron into glass, or broken objects into repaired ones.

Transform is a powerful effect, particularly in the hands
of a cunning player. To a degree, Transform can dupli-
cate certain other effects, such as trapping a target by
transforming air into a solid material or turning oxygen
into a suffocating gas (both Afflictions). This is perfectly
allowable; use the rules for other effects as guidelines
on how to handle these situations, using Transform rank
to determine resistance DCs.

Keep in mind, however, that Transform has a sustained
duration, which may affect how such “tricks” work (e.g.,
the trap disappears if the character is stunned, the suffo-
cating gas dissipates unless the character concentrates
each round to continue transforming it, etc.). As always,
the GM should use common sense and good judgment.

You  may  wish  to  require  characters  using  Transform
to  acquire  money  (gold,  precious  gems,  etc.)  or  other
permanent  material  goods  to  spend  power  points  on
ranks of the Benefit advantage to reflect this newfound
wealth; otherwise, the goods fade or remain imperma-
nent in some way. (Assuming things like wealth matter
in your series in some way.)

It is possible for Transform to effectively destroy objects:
turning a steel door into water, air, or even rust certain-
ly  removes  it  as  a  barrier.  However,  keep  in  mind  that
Transform  is  normally  sustained;  the  target  isn’t  truly
destroyed unless the effect is continuous, and therefore
irreversible. Even then, the destruction of targets tends
to be all-or-nothing. For an effect capable of wearing-
down  and  eventually  destroying  objects,  use  Weaken
Toughness instead.

Transforming living or otherwise animate beings as op-
posed to inanimate matter requires an effect other than
Transform. To alter a target’s outward appearance only,
go  with  a  Morph  Attack  (see  the  Morph  effect).  For  a
harmful effect that does something like turn the target
to

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

211

Example:  Makeshift  needs  to  whip  up  a  mind-
shielding  device  to  confront  Gepetto,  who  has
seized control of his teammates. Immunity to Mind
Control (a common Affliction effect) cost 5 power
points, so the Technology check is DC 15 (10 + 5)
and takes 5 hours. Makeshift’s skill bonus is +15, so
he succeeds automatically. The construction check
is  also  DC  15  (10  +  the  device’s  cost).  It  takes  20
hours. Makeshift again succeeds automatically on
the  check.  However,  that’s  25  hours  total  to  build
the  mind-shield,  and  Gepetto  plans  to  send  his
new “puppets” into action in just a few hours. Even
taking a –15 check penalty to cut the time to one-
eighth only takes it down to just over three hours.
Makeshift needs that device right now, so he’s go-
ing to need to speed things up....

you speed up the process any further by taking a check
penalty.  You  can  use  a  jury-rigged  invention  again  by
spending another hero point.

Example:  Needing  to  get  the  mind  shield  device
ready  right  away,  Makeshift’s  player  decides  to
spend a hero point to jury-rig it. He skips the design
step  altogether  and  reduces  construction  time  to
5 rounds (just under a minute). The DC of the con-
struction check increases to 20, but still well within
Makeshift’s skill; the player only needs to roll a 5 or
better. He rolls a 25 result on the check and, a min-
ute later, Makeshift has a makeshift mind-shield he
hopes will protect him from Gepetto’s power long
enough to try and free his teammates from the vil-
lain’s influence.

DEVICES

MISHAPS

An inventor can choose to spend a hero point to jury-rig a
device; ideal for when a particular device is needed right
now.  When  jury-rigging  a  device,  skip  the  design  check
and  reduce  the  time  of  the  construction  check  to  one
round  per  power  point  of  the  device’s  cost,  but  increase
the DC of the check by +5. The inventor makes the check
and, if successful, has use of the device for one scene be-
fore it burns out, falls apart, blows up, or otherwise fails.
You can’t jury-rig an invention as a routine check, nor can

At  the  GM’s  discretion,  three  or  more  degrees  of  failure,
or a natural roll of 1, on any required inventing skill check
may result in some unexpected side-effect or mishap. Ex-
actly  what  depends  heavily  on  the  invention.  Inventing
mishaps can become a source of adventure ideas and put
the heroes in some diff

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

WEALTH

As  heroes  earn  power  points  through  adventuring  and
spend them to improve their traits, they will eventually
run into the limits imposed by the series power level (see
Power  Level  in  Chapter  1).  For  a  while,  this  can  be  a
good thing, since the power level limits encourage play-
ers to diversify their heroes: acquiring new skills, advan-
tages,  and  powers  rather  than  simply  pumping  points
into their existing traits to increase them to higher and
higher  ranks.  However,  sooner  or  later,  you’re  going  to
want to raise the series power level, giving heroes a bit
more room for advancement and spending their earned
power points.

A good guideline is to follow the starting power point to-
tals  when  it  comes  to  power  level: When  the  heroes  ac-
cumulate  an  additional  15  power  points  from  the  start
of the series or the last time the power level was raised,
it’s probably time to consider raising the power level by
one. So a power level 10 series starts out with 150-point
heroes. When they have earned another 15 power points
(bringing their total up to 165), the GM  should  consider
raising the series power level to 11, allowing the heroes to
spend some of those points to increase traits currently at
the maximum limit.

When  you  increase  the  series  power  level,  you  should
also re-evaluate the capabilities of the villains and other
challenges the heroes face. While NPCs don’t “earn” power
points,  and  aren’t  even  subject  to  the  same  power  level
limits as the heroes, you should feel free to improve the
traits of non-player characters in the series to keep pace
with the heroes, ensuring those antagonists remain a suit-
able challenge. It’s also fine to have others lag behind, as
the heroes outstrip some of their old foes, who no longer
represent the kind of threat they did before, plus you can
always introduce new villains and challenges suited to the
series power level as things progress.

As the series progresses, you may want to slow the rate
of  increasing  power  level,  stretching  it  out  to  even  20,
30, or more earned power points. This allows opportuni-

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through
the ranks and now run the show. Physically a crime lord
is  no  match  for  a  hero,  but  their  connections,  resources,
and  knowledge  of  the  underworld  can  be  problematic.
The crime lord presented here is a fairly small fish; Game-
masters should make any changes needed to increase the
crime lord’s power and influence for the series.

self as well as other psychics.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  Some  Psychics  use
their powers for good, because they feel they must
have been given their powers to help others.

•

Power  Loss:  Because  mental  powers  often  require
some  amount  of  focus;  drugs,  disorientation  of  any
kind, or noisy settings may prevent a Psychic from us-

people they’ve interacted with using their powers.

Shapeshifters include characters who actually change their
shape to become animals, machines, mythic creatures, or hu-

be “recovered” in some fashion, such as recharging, rest,
repair, reloading, and so forth. The GM decides when and
how a faded effect recovers, but it should generally occur
outside of combat and take at least an hour’s time. The GM
may  allow  a  hero  to  recover  a  faded  effect  immediately
and completely by spending a hero point.

usable only in certain situations and those usable only on
certain  things.  For  example  Only  While  Singing  Loudly,
Only While Flying, Only on Men (or Women), Only Against
Fire, Not Usable on Yellow Things, and so forth. As a gen-
eral rule, the effect must lose about half its usefulness to
qualify  for  this  modifier.  Anything  less  limiting  is  better
handled as an occasional complication.

FEEDBACK

-1 COST PER RANK

You suffer damage when a manifestation of your effect is
damaged. This  flaw  only  applies  to  effects  with  physical
(or  apparently  physical)  manifestations,  such  as  Create,
Illusion,  or  Summon,  for  example.  If  your  power’s  mani-
festation  is  damaged,  make  a  resistance  check  against
the attack’s damage rank, using your effect’s rank as the
resistance check bonus. For example, if a manifestation of
a rank 10 effect is attacked for damage 12, you must make
a resistance check against damage 12 with a +10 bonus
(the effect’s rank) in place of your normal Toughness.

GRAB-BASED

-1 COST PER RANK

An attack effect with this flaw requires you to successfully
grab a target before using the effect (see Grab, page 248).
This generally applies to an effect that is close range, since
you have to be in close combat to grab anyway. If the ef-
fect’s default range is not close, apply the Close modifier
as well. If you do not succeed on the grab, you cannot use
the effect. If your grab attempt succeeds, the effect occurs
automatically as a reaction.

Example: Lamprey has a draining touch that is a
Grab-Based  Weaken  Strength  effect.  So  the  mon-
strous  villain  has  to  take  a  standard  action  and
make a grab first in order to use it. If his close attack
check hits, the target makes a Dodge or Fortitude
resistance  check  against  Lamprey’s  Strength.  If  it
fails, the target then makes the Fortitude resistance
check against the villain’s Weaken effect to see how
much Strength Lamprey drains away.

This  flaw  is  essentially  a  form  of  Resistible,  with  a  grab
check rather than a regular resistance check (see the Re-
sistible flaw for more).

LIGHT

You  can  raise  the  light  level  in  the  area,  countering  the
concealment of darkness, but not other forms of conceal-
ment. For 1 point per rank, you can create enough light to
reduce  total  concealment  to  partial  and  partial  conceal-
ment  to  none.  For  2  points  per  rank,  you  can  shed  light
as bright as a sunlit day, eliminating all concealment pro-
vided  by  natural  darkness.  Power  effects  with  the  dark-
ness descriptor may be countered with a successful power
check (see Countering Effects, page 148).

You impose a -2 modifier to Perception checks for 1 point
per rank, and a -5 for 2 points per rank. For more signifi-
cant  obscuring  of  senses  (via  darkness,  fog,  etc.)  use  an
Area Concealment Attack effect (see Concealment in this
chapter).
EXTRAS

Selective: With this extra you can vary the environment
within your affected area, affecting some while not affect-
ing  others,  or  even  mixing  and  matching  different  envi-
ronments (making part of the area cold and another hot,
for example). +1 cost per rank.

GENERAL

Action: None • Range: Personal
Duration: Permanent • Cost: 1 point per rank

You  have  extra  manipulative  limbs,  such  as  arms,  tenta-
cles, or even prehensile hair or a tail. Each rank in this ef-
fect grants you an extra limb.

Extra  Limbs  do  not  allow  you  to  take  additional  actions
in a round, although they do provide the benefits of the
Improved Grab advantage—grabbing with some of your
limbs and leaving others free. All additional limbs except
your dominant limb are considered your “off-hand.” If you
have the Benefit (Ambidexterity) advantage, you have no
off-hand penalties with any of your limbs.

If you apply all of your limbs to a grab attempt (rather than
taking the option to leave some of them free), you gain a

HOOD: EXTRA LIMBS, NOT EXTRA ACTIONS

As a default, Extra Limbs do not grant characters the abil-
ity to take extra actions in a round, simply because multi-
ple actions—especially extra standard actions usable for
attacks—tend to slow down and unbalance play.

As  an  option  for  including  some  combat  benefits  with
Extra  Limbs,  consider  allowing  the  application  of  the
Multiattack extra to the Strength of a character with Extra
Limbs, reflecting the ability to launch a flurry of attacks
at a single opponent, or to “spread” those attacks among
a number of nearby opponents. See the Multiattack de-
scription under Extras in this

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  The  villain  Doctor  Shock  can  create  an
aura  of  electricity  around  his  body,  damaging  any-
one  or  anything  touching  him.  This  is  a  Reaction
Damage effect, causing Damage when Doctor Shock
is touched. Of course, Doctor Shock’s aura zaps any-
one  or  anything  touching  him,  including  his  allies!
The only way he can prevent this is to turn the aura
off  altogether.  If  Doctor  Shock  possessed  the  ability
to have his aura only damage people and things he
wants it to damage, he would need to have the Selec-
tive modifier applied to the effect as well.

The Reaction modifier applies +1 cost per rank to effects
with  a  default  action  of  free,  +3  cost  per  rank  to  effects
with a default standard action.

FLAT • 1 POINT

You can remove conditions caused by a Reversible effect at
will as a free action, so long as the subject is within the ef-
fect’s range. Examples include removing the damage condi-
tions caused by a Damage effect, repairing damage done by
Weaken Toughness, or removing an Affliction instantly. Nor-
mally, you have no control over the results of such effects.

RICOCHET

FLAT • 1 POINT PER RANK

You  can  ricochet  or  bounce  an  attack  effect  with  this
modifier off of a solid surface to change its direction. This
allows you to attack around corners, overcome cover and
possibly  make  a  surprise  attack  against  an  opponent.  It
does not allow you to affect multiple targets. The “bounce”
has no effect apart from changing the attack’s direction.
You  must  be  able  to  define  a  clear  path  for  your  attack,
which must follow a straight line between each ricochet.
Each  rank  in  Ricochet  allows  you  to  bounce  the  attack
once before it hits. Ricochet may grant a bonus to hit due
to surprise, at the GM’s discretion.

+1 COST PER RANK

An  instant  duration  effect  with  this  modifier  affects  the
target  once  immediately  (when  the  effect  is  used)  and
then  once  again  on  the  following  round,  at  the  end  of
the attacker’s turn. The target gets the normal resistance
check against the secondary effect.

Secondary Effects don’t stack, so if you attack a target with
your Secondary Effect on the round after a successful hit,
it doesn’t affect the target twice; it simply delays the sec-
ond  effect  for  another  round. You  can  attack  the  target
with a different effect, however. So, for example, if you hit
a target with a Secondary Damage Effect then, o

mankind, he or she may also become a hero for the
same reason.

•  Motivation—Recognition:  Some  Gadgeteers  want
their genius recognized not just by other  scientists,
but by millions of adoring fans.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  The  Gadgeteer  often
feels it’s only right to use his or her incredible intel-
ligence to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Gadgeteers  love  to  push  the
limit and live on the edge of scientific research, so it
only makes sense that they might like dressing up in
tights and taking on the role of a hero.

•

•

Quirk—Psychological Problems: Perhaps the Gad-
geteer’s  devices  have  slowly  been  poisoning  his
or  her  mind,  or  biofeedback  caused  by  improperly
functioning cybernetics or other mechanical systems
have  caused  the  Gadgeteer  to  exhibit  some  sort  of
mental problem.

Relationship:  Gadgeteers  often  have  a  number  of
important  people  in  their  life,  either  family,  loved
ones, other researchers, or employees who like to get
into trouble.

The Martial Artist has honed his skills in unarmed combat
to  bridge  the  physical  gap  between  him  and  his  super-
powered  associates.  In  fact,  some  Martial  Artists  display
feats  that  seem  impossible  by  normal  standards—and
may have a mystical origin.

PRINCESS

Julia wants to play a fairly straightforward hero: super-strong and tough, but also a beautiful
young woman with an eye for fashion! She draws a sketch of a smiling, slender woman in a

pink T-shirt that says “Princess” on it in silver sequins, holding a car over her head!

Right off, Julia knows Princess is strong, really strong. So she assigns her Strength 12;
higher than PL10, but still not so high that she can’t also have a reasonable close
combat bonus. That Strength is enough for Princess to lift a hundred tons! She

can heft that car with ease! Julia gives her Stamina 12 to match.

Since she sees Princess as graceful, like a gymnast, Julia gives her Agility
5, but she goes with Dexterity 3, since her character isn’t as coordinated
(although she’s still above average). Likewise, Julia assigns Princess 2 ranks
each  in  Intellect,  Awareness,  and  Presence;  she’s  smart,  sassy,  and  deter-
mined, but not amazingly so. Julia wants Princess to be a capable close-up
fighter, so she gives her Fighting 6. That’s a total of 44 ranks in abilities for 88

power points, leaving 62 remaining.

Next up: powers. Julia wants Princess to be fast and tough. She gives her 4 ranks of
Speed, allowing her to keep up with a slow-moving car, and assigns her 5 ranks in Im-
munity (allowing her to ignore cold, disease, heat, pressure, and radiation) along with some
Impervious Toughness (8 ranks) and Regeneration (2 ranks). That’s 19 points in powers,

43 remaining.

Given her great Strength and Agility, Julia also sees Princess as being able to jump re-
ally far, so she gives her 7 ranks in Leaping as well. That’s another 7 points, leaving 36.

Julia looks over the advantage list, taking notes as she goes. She likes the idea of
Princess being a real toughy: having things like Diehard and Ultimate Tough-
ness,  along  with  Interpose  (allowing  her  to  take  the  hit  for  a  teammate).
But she also wants her to be quick and inspirational. She likes Attractive,
Extraordinary  Effort,  Inspire,  and  Well-informed.  That’s  seven  advan-
tages thus far. She rounds out the list with some combat maneuvers
like All-out Attack and Power Attack (since Princess can cut loose if
she needs to), Improved Initiative (she’s quick) and another rank
of Inspire. That’s another four advantages, for a total of 11 points.

Julia  asks  the  Gamemaster  about  one  more  advantage:

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

143

In  some  settings,  the  Gamemaster  may  require  certain
descriptors  for  all  powers.  Usually,  a  required  descrip-
tor reflects some common element of the series. For ex-
ample, if all characters with powers are mutants, then all
powers  have  the “mutant”  descriptor  by  definition,  un-
less  the  player  comes  up  with  a  good  explanation  why
they should not. If all superhumans are psychic mutants,
then  all  powers  have  both  the  “psychic”  and  “mutant”
descriptors. The GM sets the rules as far as what descrip-
tors are required (or restricted) in the series. A character
who breaks this guideline—say the one alien in a setting
where all powers are otherwise mutant in origin—might
have a Benefit (unusual origin) or face certain complica-
tions, possibly both.

Effects with a duration of instant, concentration, or sustained
must be noticeable in some way. For example, a Blast effect
might  have  a  visible  beam  or  make  a  loud  noise  (ZAP!)  or
both. Some effects are quite obvious, such as Flight, Insub-
stantiality, Growth, or Shrinking. Effects with a continuous or
permanent duration are not noticeable by default.

If an instant, concentration, or sustained effect’s base dura-
tion is changed using modifiers, the effect remains notice-
able. A continuous or permanent effect made instant, con-
centration, or sustained also becomes noticeable. The Subtle
modifier (see page 196) can make noticeable powers difficult
or impossible to detect. Conversely, the Noticeable modifier
(see page 200) makes a normally subtle effect noticeable.

tice, Law, Liberty, Tyranny

“Powers” in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS refer to all extraordinary
traits other than abilities, skills, and advantages. Whether a
character  with  powers  is “superhuman”  or  not  is  largely  a
matter of opinion and the descriptors used. For example,
there are lots of comic book characters with superhuman
traits  still  considered “normal”

EXTRAS

Area: Your Luck Control effect works equally on all targets
in the affected area. You spend only one hero point, but
the subjects are each affected individually. You must ap-
ply the same effect to all subjects at once. +1 cost per rank.

Luck: Each rank in this extra gives you the benefit of a rank
in the Luck advantage (see Luck in the Advantages chap-
ter). It is subject to the same limits as the Luck advantage
set by the GM. Flat +1 point per rank of Luck.

Selective: This extra, applied to Area Luck Control, allows
you to choose who in the area is or is not affected by it. +1
cost per rank.

FLAWS

Action: If the action required for Luck Control is increased
beyond a reaction, it is only usable during your turn each

Effect:  Perception  Ranged  Damage,  Resisted  by  Will  •
4 points per rank

You can strike targets’ minds with “mental force,” inflict-
ing  Damage  resisted  by  the  target’s  Will  rather  than
Toughness, but having no effect on targets immune to
effects resisted by Will, such as inanimate objects. Men-
tal Blasts are often, but not always, Subtle as well, which
costs a flat 1 point.

MAGIC

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You are a sorcerer, witch, or wizard, able to cast a variety
of magical spells. Your basic default effect is a Blast of
eldritch  force,  able  to  inflict  Ranged  Damage  (see  the
Blast power, previously).

However,  like  the  Energy  Control  power,  Magic  can
have a wide range of Alternate Effects, each a separate
spell you have mastered. The possibilities are virtually
limitless, within the bounds of your hero’s descriptors
and  the  Gamemaster’s  approval.  Examples  include
mystic  bindings  (Affliction,  see  the  Snare  version),
dispelling  magical  effects  (Nullify  Magic),  conjuring
clouds of mist or fog (an Area Visual Concealment At-
tack), scrying distant places (Remote Sensing), or slip-
ping  between  the  dimensions  to  appear  elsewhere
(Teleport), to name just a few.

All Magic effects have the “magic” descriptor regardless
of their other descriptors, so a Blast of flames conjured
with magic has both the “magic” and “fire” descriptors,
for example.

Magicians  often  have  a  Power  Loss  complication  (see
Complications  in  The  Basics  chapter):  if  they  are  un-
able to freely speak and gesture to cast their spells, they
cannot  use  Magic  (or  any  related  magical  powers  reli-
ant on spellcasting). Certain styles of Magic may impose

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

The  communications  feature  allows  the  headquarters
to receive and transmit on a wide range of radio and TV
bands,  monitor  police  and  emergency  channels,  coor-
dinate  communications  between  members  of  a  team,
and  so  forth.  It  includes  communications  equipment,
consoles, and monitors. The system’s access to restricted
communication  bands  depends  on  the  clearance  and
skills  of  the  user.  Heroes  often  have  access  to  special
government  channels,  while  a  successful  Technology
skill check (DC 25) can grant a user illegal access to re-
stricted systems.

COMPUTER

A  state-of-the-art  computer  system  serves  the  entire
headquarters.  This  allows  characters  to  make  full  use
of  the  Technology  skill  and  the  computer  can  be  pro-
grammed  to  handle  routine  base  functions  (including
monitoring  communications  channels  and  controlling
defensive  systems).  An  artificially  intelligent  computer
system should be created as a Minion or Sidekick, perhaps
with the cost shared among members of a team. See the
Constructs section for more.

CONCEALED

The  headquarters  is  hidden  from  the  outside  world  in
some way. It may be camouflaged behind a false façade,
buried underground, or something similar. Note this is in

addition to the Isolated feature, if any. An isolated head-
quarters is difficult to reach, while a concealed headquar-
ters  is  difficult  to  find  in  the  first  place.  Skill  checks  to
locate the headquarters have their DC increased by +10.
Each  additional  feature  applied  to  this  increases  the  DC
+5, to a maximum of +30.

A  defense  system  consists  of  various  weapon  emplace-
ments  defending  the  exterior  and  interior  of  the  head-
quarters.  A  defense  system  can  have  any  attack  effect
with  a  cost  no  greater  than  twice  the  HQ  power  level.
Their attack bonus is equal to the power level.

A  villainous  version  of  the  Defense  System  feature  is
deathtraps: the villain’s lair has one or more fiendish traps
suitable for disposing of those pesky heroes. Some death-
traps are designed as security systems to keep heroes out:
concealed auto-guns, walls of flames, sealing rooms that
fill with water or sand, and so forth. Others are intended
for the slow elimination of captured heroes.

Note that not having this feature does not mean a villain
cannot jury-rig a deathtrap wit

ply to at least one rank, and may apply to as many ranks as
the effect has. The change in cost and effect applies only
to the ranks with the modifier; the unmodified ranks have
their normal cost and effect.

Example:  Caliber’s  micro-rockets  are  a  Damage  7
effect. They also explode on impact, for a Burst Area
Damage  effect,  but  the  Area  Damage  is  only  rank
4. So the first 4 ranks of the Caliber’s Damage effect
have the Burst Area modifier, costing 1 point more (or
3 per rank). The remaining 3 ranks have their usual
cost (2 per rank). Caliber makes a normal ranged at-
tack check against the main target for his micro-rock-
et launcher; if he hits, the target has to resist Damage
7, and everyone within the area around the target re-
sists Damage 4 (the Area Damage). Even if he misses,
the main target has to resist the Area Damage 4, since
the micro-rocket explodes close by! In Caliber’s busi-
ness, it pays to cover your bases...

MODIFIERS

Some modifiers, rather than increasing or decreasing an ef-
fect’s cost per rank, have a flat value in power points, noted
as flat in the modifier’s header. For example, the Subtle extra
costs only 1 or 2 points, depending on how subtle the effect
is. Likewise, the Activation flaw has a flat value of –1 or –2
points, depending on how long the power takes to activate.

Flat-value modifiers are applied to the final cost of an effect,
after its cost per rank and total cost for its number of ranks
is determined. So, for example, if an effect costs 2 points per
rank, with +1 per rank for extras and –2 per rank for flaws.
It has a final adjusted cost of (2 + 1 – 2) or 1 point per rank.
With 8 ranks, it costs 8 power points. If the same effect also
has a flat-value extra costing 2 points and a flat-value flaw
worth –1 point, then you add 2 to the final cost and sub-
tract 1, for a total of (8 points for the effect + 2 points for the
flat extra – 1 point for the flat flaw) or 9 power points.

tion). When  an  effect  is  used  against  a  corporeal  target,
the effect’s rank is equal to the rank of this extra, up to a
maximum of the effect’s full rank. Characters with lower
ranks  1–3  of  Insubstantial  do  not  require  this  extra  for
their effects to work on the physical world, although they
can apply it to their Strength rank to allow them to exert
some Strength while Insubstantial.

out of the way, and so forth). A successful resistance check
reduces the Area effect to half its normal rank against that
target (round down, minimum of 1 rank).

•

SHAPE

Choose one of the following options:

•

•

•

•

•

Burst: The effect fills a sphere with a 30-foot radius
(distance  rank  0).  Bursts  on  level  surfaces  (like  the
ground)  create  hemispheres  30  feet  in  radius  and
height.

Cloud: The effect fills a sphere with a 15-foot radius
(distance  rank  –1)  that  lingers  in  that  area  for  one
round after its duration expires (affecting any targets
in  the  area  normally  during  the  additional  round).
Clouds  on  level  surfaces  (like  the  ground)  create
hemispheres 15 feet in radius and height.

Cone:  The  effect  fills  a  cone  with  a  length,  width,
and height of 60 feet (distance rank 1), spreading out
from the effect’s starting point. Cones on a level sur-
face halve their final height.

Cylinder: The effect fills a cylinder 30 feet in radius
and height (distance rank 0).

Line:  The  effect  fills  a  path  6  feet  wide  and  30  feet
long  (distance  ranks  -2  and  0,  respectively)  in  a
straight  line.  Additional  ranks  of  area  increases  the
length.  To  increase  the  width,  purchase  additional
ranks for that.

Perception: The effect works on anyone able to per-
ceive the target point with a particular sense, chosen
when you apply this extra, like a Sense-Dependent ef-
fect (see the Sense-Dependent modifier). Targets get
a Dodge resistance check, as usual, but if the check is
successful suffer no effect (rather than half). Conceal-
ment that prevents a target from perceiving the effect
also blocks it. This modifier includes the Sense-Depen-
dent flaw (see Flaws) so it cannot be applied again. If
it is applied to an already Sense-Dependent effect, it
costs 2 points per rank rather than 1.

•

Shapeable: The effect fills a volume of 30 cubic feet
(volume rank 5), and you may shape the volume as
you wish, so long as it all remains contiguous. Affect-
ing  an  average-sized  human  requires  4  cubic  feet
(volume rank 2).

Each +1 point increase in cost per rank moves the area’s
distance  rank  up  by  1.  So  a  Burst  Area  with  +2  cost  per
rank has a 60-foot radius (distance rank 1), a 120-foot ra-
dius at +3 cost per rank (distance rank 2), and so forth.
RANGE

Trucks  include  pick-ups,  sport  utility
vehicles (SUVs), vans, and similarly
sized vehicles.

Tanks are heavily armed
and  armored  vehicles.
The standard tank has
Tough-
Impervious
ness  12  and  comes
equipped  with  a  can-
non  (Ranged  Damage  10,
Burst Area 6) and a heavy machine
gun (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6). It
takes a move action to get into or out
of a  tank, and another move action
to start it up.

APCs or Armored Personnel Car-
riers,  are  designed  for  carry-
ing  troops.  They  come  with
a  smaller  cannon  (Ranged
Damage  6,  Burst  Area  4),
Impervious  Toughness  8,
and are set up so soldiers on
board can fire their personal
weapons  from  behind  the
cover of the APC’s armor.

Water vehicles range from small boats and outboards to
massive sea-going ships.

Cutters are used by the Coast Guard and the Navy. They’re
often equipped with light machine guns (Ranged Multiat-
tack Damage 6).

Destroyers  are  main  naval  ships,  carrying  heavy  guns
(Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area 8).

Battleships have massive gun batteries (Ranged Damage
13, Burst Area 9) and heavy armor.

Submarines are equipped with torpedoes (Ranged Dam-
age  8,  Burst  Area  5)  and  often  ballistic  missiles  (Ranged
Burst  Area  Damage  15  or  higher,  not  included  in  listed
cost).

Air vehicles are all capable of flight, some of them at very
high speeds.

Military  helicopters  are  equipped  with  machine  guns
(Ranged  Multiattack  Damage  6)  and  rockets  (Ranged
Damage 9, Burst Area 6).

Fighter  jets  have  machine  guns  (Ranged  Multiattack
Damage  6)  and  air-to-air  missiles  (Ranged  Damage  11,
Burst Area 8, Homing 6).

Bombers may have machine guns and missiles, but also
have powerful bombs (Burst Area Damage 12 or higher)
they can drop on targets.

Space  vehicles  are  intended  for  use  outside  the  atmo-
sphere, some of them for interplanetary or even interstel-
lar travel. Generally space vehicles are found in the pos-
session of alien civilizations, although the GM may choose
to allow some organizations and individuals on Earth to
have space vehicles.

Space fighters are armed with blaster cannons (Ranged
Damage 10).

Space cruisers have larger beam weapons (Ranged Dam-
age 12) and often energy torpedoes (Ranged Damage 12,
Burst Area 10, Homing 8).

Protection,  although  the  rocket’s  Damage  typically  does
most of that work. Most rocket launchers can fire only one
or two shots before they must be reloaded (standard ac-
tion, meaning the launcher cannot fire that turn).

Bolos: A set of weighted cords intended to entangle an
opponent  with  a  Snare  Affliction  that  hinders  and  im-
pedes, then renders the target defenseless and immobile.
See Snare in the Powers chapter for details.

Boomerang: A common throwing weapon for heroes, a
thrown boomerang returns to the thrower’s hand, ready
to be thrown again on the next round (less a Feature and
more a special descriptor). Boomerang wielders often use
this  property  of  the  weapon  to  feint,  allowing  for  an  at-
tack against a vulnerable target on the return arc on the
attacker’s next turn.

Javelin: Light, flexible spears intended to be thrown. Jav-
elins can also be used in melee combat.

Shuriken: Flat metal stars or spikes for throwing. Shuriken
can be thrown in groups as a Multiattack. Although they
are  thrown  weapons,  shuriken  are  not  Strength-based,
being too light.

The following accessories can be added to the projectile

ter of the burst. This immunity does not apply to other
effects, nor does it extend to anyone else: for that, ap-
ply the Selective extra. If the user wants to be affected
at the same time, increase cost per rank by +1. An ex-
ample would be a Close Burst Area Healing effect that
included the user along with everyone else in the area.
This is the equivalent of the +1 Affects Others modifier.

Ranged:  A  ranged  area  effect  can  be  placed  any-
where within the effect’s range, extending to fill the
area’s volume from the origin point.

Perception: A perception area effect can be placed
anywhere  the  user  can  accurately  perceive.  Percep-
tion area effects neither require an attack check nor
allow a Dodge resistance check, although targets still
get a normal resistance check against the effect. Per-
ception  area  effects  are  blocked  by  either  conceal-
ment or cover; choose one when acquiring the effect.
For concealment, if the attacker can’t accurately per-
ceive a target in the area, it is unaffected. Thus even
heavy smoke or darkness can block the effect. Effects
blocked by cover are much like conventional area ef-
fects:  solid  barriers  interfere  with  the  effect,  even  if
they are transparent, but the effect ignores conceal-
ment like darkness, shadows, or smoke. Only targets
behind total cover are unaffected.

Example: Mastermind has a Burst Area Affliction, al-
lowing him to seize control of the minds of everyone
in  the  affected  area.  He  must  be  able  to  accurately
perceive a target to control it; an invisible foe or one
out of his line of sight, for example, would be unaffect-
ed, even if they were within the area of the burst. On
the other hand, targets behind a glass wall or invisible
force field are affected, since Mastermind can perceive
them. Conversely, Fear-Master has a Burst Area Afflic-
tion as well—his fear-inducing gas. Targets behind a
solid barrier (such as on the other side of that glass
wall or invisible shield) are unaffected, but the unseen
or concealed target is, even though Fear-Master can’t
perceive him, since the gas still reaches them.

+0 COST PER RANK

This  extra  applies  to  personal  range  effects,  making
them into attack effects. Examples include Shrinking and
Teleport, causing a target to shrink or teleport away, re-
spectively.  Unlike  most  extras,  the  effect’s  cost  does  not
change, although it does work differently.

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

Trucks  include  pick-ups,  sport  utility
vehicles (SUVs), vans, and similarly
sized vehicles.

Tanks are heavily armed
and  armored  vehicles.
The standard tank has
Tough-
Impervious
ness  12  and  comes
equipped  with  a  can-
non  (Ranged  Damage  10,
Burst Area 6) and a heavy machine
gun (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6). It
takes a move action to get into or out
of a  tank, and another move action
to start it up.

APCs or Armored Personnel Car-
riers,  are  designed  for  carry-
ing  troops.  They  come  with
a  smaller  cannon  (Ranged
Damage  6,  Burst  Area  4),
Impervious  Toughness  8,
and are set up so soldiers on
board can fire their personal
weapons  from  behind  the
cover of the APC’s armor.

Water vehicles range from small boats and outboards to
massive sea-going ships.

Cutters are used by the Coast Guard and the Navy. They’re
often equipped with light machine guns (Ranged Multiat-
tack Damage 6).

Destroyers  are  main  naval  ships,  carrying  heavy  guns
(Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area 8).

Battleships have massive gun batteries (Ranged Damage
13, Burst Area 9) and heavy armor.

Submarines are equipped with torpedoes (Ranged Dam-
age  8,  Burst  Area  5)  and  often  ballistic  missiles  (Ranged
Burst  Area  Damage  15  or  higher,  not  included  in  listed
cost).

Air vehicles are all capable of flight, some of them at very
high speeds.

Military  helicopters  are  equipped  with  machine  guns
(Ranged  Multiattack  Damage  6)  and  rockets  (Ranged
Damage 9, Burst Area 6).

Fighter  jets  have  machine  guns  (Ranged  Multiattack
Damage  6)  and  air-to-air  missiles  (Ranged  Damage  11,
Burst Area 8, Homing 6).

Bombers may have machine guns and missiles, but also
have powerful bombs (Burst Area Damage 12 or higher)
they can drop on targets.

Space  vehicles  are  intended  for  use  outside  the  atmo-
sphere, some of them for interplanetary or even interstel-
lar travel. Generally space vehicles are found in the pos-
session of alien civilizations, although the GM may choose
to allow some organizations and individuals on Earth to
have space vehicles.

Space fighters are armed with blaster cannons (Ranged
Damage 10).

Space cruisers have larger beam weapons (Ranged Dam-
age 12) and often energy torpedoes (Ranged Damage 12,
Burst Area 10, Homing 8).

Space  battleships  have  the  most  massive  weapons:

SUMMONER

The Summoner is an archetype that covers a lot of ground,
from heroes who create duplicates of themselves to those
who animate images, summon otherworldly creatures, or
create minions out of thin air. In order to make the Sum-
moner fit into this book, these tables produce a duplicator
(who  summons  duplicates  of  him-  or  herself )  or  a  sum-
moner whose summoned creatures are minions with de-
cent combat abilities.

There are a few options for the duplicator: a Martial Artist,
and Energy Controller, and a Powerhouse. These are only
examples of the sorts of duplicators you can use and you
are free to swap points around to change your duplicating
Martial Artist into a duplicating Battlesuit, Crime Fighter,
Weapon Master or any other archetype, just be sure the
duplicates  remain  within  their  power  level  limits  (117
points and PL8 for Twin or 100 points and PL7 for Triplets,
plus the cost of the Summon power).

Note  that  on  the  tables  below,  things  are  a  bit  different
than for the other archetypes in this book. Follow the in-
structions and it should be clear. The change is necessary
because  the  Summon  power  your  character  has  influ-
ences the number of points available to spend on other
sections of the character.

less than ideal conditions. This section details some of the
hazards heroes may face.

FALLING

Criminals  often  lurk  in  the  darkness,  and  many  crimes
take  place  at  night.  Most  cities  are  lit  well  enough,  but
sometimes  heroes  run  into  areas  where  it’s  difficult  to
see. Poorly lit areas provide concealment. Characters with
Counters Concealment (Darkness) Senses or other appro-
priate Senses effects can ignore concealment penalties for
poor lighting.

Intense  heat  and  cold  wear  down  characters,  while  pro-
longed exposure to the elements can be extremely dan-
gerous.

Characters in hot or cold conditions must make Fortitude
checks (DC 10, +1 per previous check) to avoid becoming
fatigued.  Fatigued  characters  who  fail  a  check  become
exhausted, then incapacitated, at which point the charac-
ter’s condition becomes dying after another failed Forti-
tude check.

How  often  characters  have  to  make  Fortitude  checks  de-
pends on the conditions. Once an hour for uncomfortable
heat or cold (a hot summer day or cold winter day), once
per 10 minutes for intense heat or cold (a blazing desert or
arctic conditions), once a minute for extreme heat or cold
like the edge of a volcano or an arctic winter storm. Checks
are made at the end of each period of exposure. Truly in-
tense heat or cold—such as a blast furnace or touching liq-
uid nitrogen—inflicts direct damage like an attack.

Characters with the appropriate Immunity do not need to
make Fortitude checks for extreme temperatures.

Heroes  can  go  without  water  for  a  day.  After  this,  they
need to make a Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous
check) each hour to avoid a level of fatigue. Heroes can go
without food for three days. After this, they must make a
Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each day
to  avoid  fatigue.  The  character  cannot  recover  until  he
gets  water  or  food.  Heroes  with  Immunity  to  Starvation
can go an unlimited time without food or water.

Characters can hold their breath for ten rounds (one min-
ute) plus a number of rounds equal to twice their Stamina.
After that time they must make a Fortitude check (DC 10)
each round to continue holding their breath. The DC in-
creases  by  +1  for  each  previous  success.  Failure  on  the
Fortitude  check  means  the  character  becomes  incapaci-
tated . On the following round the character is dying. A dy-
ing character cannot stabilize until

hand” for talking about a group of basic conditions that
go together in a particular circumstance, much like a pow-
er is a collection of basic effects.

The individual conditions making up a combined condi-
tion can be resolved individually. For example, if an effect
that removes the dazed condition is used on a staggered
character (who is dazed and hindered), then the character
is no longer dazed, only hindered. Similarly, if an effect im-
poses a condition that supersedes part of the combined
condition, only that part changes. So an effect that stuns a
staggered character means the character is now stunned
(superseding  dazed)  and  hindered.  Similarly,  an  effect
that immobilizes a staggered character leaves the target
dazed and immobile (superseding the hindered element
of the combined condition).

•

•

•

Asleep:  While  asleep,  a  character  is  defenseless,
stunned,  and  unaware.  A  hearing  Perception  check
with  three  or  more  degrees  of  success  wakes  the
character and removes all these conditions, as does
any sudden movement (such as shaking the sleeping
character) or any effect allowing a resistance check.

Blind:  The  character  cannot  see.  Everything  ef-
fectively  has  full  visual  concealment  from  him.  He
is  hindered,  visually  unaware,  and  vulnerable,  and
may be impaired or disabled for activities where vi-
sion is a factor.

Bound: A bound character is defenseless, immobile,
and impaired.

Deaf: The  character  cannot  hear,  giving  everything
total  auditory  concealment  from  him.  This  may  al-
low  for  surprise  attacks  on  the  unaware  character
(see  Surprise  Attack  in  the  Action  &  Adventure
chapter). Interaction with other characters is limited
to  sign-language  and  lip-reading  (see  Interaction
Skills in Chapter 3).

Dying: A dying character is incapacitated (defense-
less, stunned, and unaware) and near death. When
the  character  gains  this  condition,  immediately
make  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  15).  If  the  check  suc-
ceeds,  nothing  happens. With  two  degrees  of  suc-
cess,  the  character  stabilizes,  removing  this  condi-
tion. If the check fails, the character remains dying.
Three  or  more  total  degrees  of  failure  mean  the
character  dies:  so  three  failed  Fortitude  checks  or
one or two checks adding up to three degrees. Dy-
ing  characters  make  a  Fortitude  check  each  round

appropriate type of check, a Difficulty Class, and make a
roll to see if the character succeeds or not! It’s that simple.

RANK

Every trait in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS —abilities, skills, pow-
ers, and so forth—has an associated rank, a value telling
you how strong (or weak) that trait is. Ranks run from –5
(very  weak)  all  the  way  up  to  20  (incredibly  strong)  or
more. You can rate virtually any trait by its rank. With the
correspondence of rank and measure, you can rate virtu-
ally  anything—distance,  weight,  time,  and  so  forth—by
rank.

Every  task—from  making  an  attack  to  avoiding  harm  to
figuring out a gadget—has a Difficulty Class or DC, a value
that tells you how hard that task is to perform. DCs range
from  0  (automatic,  so  easy  it’s  not  worth  rolling)  to  40
(nearly impossible).
CHECKS

Actions in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS are all resolved through
checks, a roll of a 20-sided die, plus a modifier. If the total
of the check equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class, the ac-
tion is a success. If it doesn’t, then it’s a failure.

Beneficial conditions apply a +2 bonus on the check (+5
for very highly beneficial), adverse conditions impose a –2
penalty (–5 for highly adverse). This is true whether you’re
trying to use a skill, make an attack, use a power, or what
have you.

Avoiding  an  effect  is  a  resistance  check,  with  a  Difficulty
Class of 10 + the effect’s modifier or rank. A successful re-
sistance means you avoid the effect, a failed check means
you suffer some (or all) of the effect.

THAT’S IT!

That’s the core of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS: roll d20 + rank and
modifiers vs. a Difficulty Class. If you understand that, you
can do pretty much anything in the game. The rest is just
detail. When in doubt, or whenever you want to speed the
game along, just have a player make a check of the appro-
priate trait rank against a DC based on how difficult the
task is and you can’t really go wrong.

Part of the Gamemaster’s job is to make sure the game
is fair and balanced, so everyone can have a good time
and all the heroes have an equal chance of doing some

fun and exciting things in the course of the adventure. It
can be tricky sometimes, but MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS gives
you  tools  for  balancing  the  traits  of  the  heroes  against
different  challenges  and  handling  problems  that  may
come up.

While MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS presents a fairly complete and
balanced game
