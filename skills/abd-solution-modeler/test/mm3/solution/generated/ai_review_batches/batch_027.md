round, which limits its usefulness in responding to the ac-
tions of others. –1 cost per rank.

Ranged: Luck Control normally requires no attack check;
if Ranged, it does. –1 cost per rank.

Resistible: Targets  of  your  Luck  Control  get  a  resistance
check—usually Dodge or Will—to avoid its effects. –1 cost
per rank.

Side Effect: As a particular side effect of Luck Control, if
your  effort  to  alter  luck  fails,  you  suffer  a  setback  with-
out earning a hero point. Effectively the GM gains a “free”
complication against you. –1 or –2 cost per rank.

SENSORY

Effect:  Perception  Ranged,  Cumulative  Affliction,  Re-
sisted by Will • 4 points per rank

You  can  impose  your  will  on  others,  forcing  them  to
obey  your  commands. Targets  failing  a Will  resistance
check against your effect DC first become dazed, then
compelled, as they try to fight off your influence. Finally,
with  three  or  more  degrees  of  effect,  the  target  be-
comes controlled and obeys any commands you give.

Degrees  of  failure  on  resistance  checks  against  Mind
Control are cumulative. You can also apply the Progres-
sive modifier (see the Affliction effect) so your mental
hold  increases  each  time  the  target  fails  a  resistance
check against it!

Action: Standard • Range: Perception
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 point per rank

MIMIC

You can read another character’s mind. To use Mind Read-
ing,  make  an  opposed  effect  check  against  the  result  of
the target’s Will check. The degree of success determines
the degree of contact:

4

Surface  thoughts: You  can  read  what  the
target  is  presently  thinking.  Mind  Reading
transcends language; you comprehend the
target’s thoughts whether or not you share
a common language.

Personal thoughts: You can probe deeper
into  the  target’s  mind  for  information. You
can  essentially  ask  any  one  question  and
receive  the  answer  from  the  target’s  mind.
If the target doesn’t know the answer, then
you know that as well.

Memory: You can read the subject’s memo-
ries  and  recollections.  This  allows  you  to
perceive  them  exactly  as  the  target  recalls
them, one memory per round.

Subconscious:  You  can  read  memories
from the target’s subconscious, things even
the  target  does  not  consciously  know. This
might mean repressed or hidden memories,
deep-seated psychological traumas, or even
other personalities.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Variable (assumed forms), Move Action • 8 points
per rank

You  can  transform  into  different  forms,  gaining  the
physical  traits  (abilities,  skills,  advantages,  and  pow-
ers) of the assumed form. You gain (Shapeshift rank x 5)
power points worth of traits. You can also redistribute
points spent on your own physical traits (lowering your
Strength to apply those points elsewhere, for example).
You are limited to the inherent traits of the forms you
assume and do not gain new mental traits, even if that
form possesses them.

Shapeshift is often further Limited by the specific types
of forms the character can assume, such as Limited to
Animals or Limited to Machines.

ter’s perceptions are unreliable, the sense appears to work,
but the character gets the wrong information. For this rea-
son, the GM should make all reliability checks for Senses
in secret, just informing the player of what the character
does (or does not) notice. –1 cost per rank.

SHRINKING

GENERAL

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can temporarily decrease your size, becoming smaller,
harder to see — and hit — at the cost of losing Strength
and  speed.  Every  4  ranks  of  Shrinking  reduces  your  size
rank by 1 (normal humans are size rank –2 by default) and
each reduction in size rank subtracts 1 from your Strength
and every two reductions in size rank subtract 1 from your
ground speed rank. Add half your Shrinking rank (rounded
down)  to  your  active  defenses.  Add  your  Shrinking  rank
as a bonus to Stealth checks, since you are harder to spot,
but apply half your rank (rounded down) as a penalty to In-
timidation checks (hard to be imposing when you’re tiny).
Shrinking modifiers are restricted by power level limits.

So  at  Shrinking  12,  you  are  size  rank  –5  (about  6  inches
tall),  and  have  a  +6  bonus  to  active  defenses  and  +12
Stealth bonus, but –3 Strength, –1 speed, and –6 Intimida-
tion penalties.
EXTRAS

Atomic: At Shrinking 20 (and size rank –7), you can shrink
down to the molecular or even atomic level, allowing you
to pass through solid objects by slipping between their at-
oms. It takes at least a full turn to do so, possibly longer for
larger objects. You’re effectively immune to damage and
many effects at this scale, since you are essentially shifted
out of the ordinary universe. The GM decides if a particular
effect can reach you at the atomic level. If you have

mimics  other’s  traits  is  limited  to  the  traits  its
subject(s)  possess;  a  Variable  effect  pro-
viding  you  with  traits  suitable  to  dif-
ferent shapes is limited by the form(s)
you  assume;  a  Variable  effect  pro-
viding  adaptations  is  limited  to  the
stimulus  to  which  it  adapts,  and
so  forth.  This  descriptor  does  not
reduce  the  effect’s  cost  unless  it’s
especially  narrow  or  limiting,  and
the GM is the final arbiter of what con-
stitutes  a  suitable  descriptor  and  which
descriptors are narrow enough to qualify
for a Limited flaw.

The  allocation  of  your  Variable  points  is
sustained,  so  if  you  stop  maintaining  your
Variable  effect  for  any  reason,  your  allo-
cated points “reset” to a “null” state: you lose
any temporary traits and must take the
action  necessary  to  reallocate  your
Variable  points  again  on  your  turn  to
regain  them.  Points  in  a  Continuous
Variable  effect  remain  where  you  set
them  without  maintenance,  unless  the
Variable  effect  itself  is  countered  or  nul-
lified.  Variable  effects  cannot  be  perma-
nent in duration by definition.

EXTRAS

Action: You can change the configuration of
your effect faster, although only a Reaction
Variable  can  change  more  often  than  once
per turn, and then only in response to its trig-
gering  circumstances.  Gamemasters  should
exercise  caution  with  Variable  effects  that
can be reconfigured as a free action or re-
action:  they  not  only  grant  tremendous
flexibility,  they  can  also  slow  down  game
play as the player considers virtually infinite
possibilities for each action using the Variable
effect. Move Action: +1 cost per rank . Free Action: +2 cost
per rank. Reaction: +3 cost per rank.

Affects Others: You can grant effects to someone
else. The subject granted the use of the effect con-
trols  its  configuration,  if  appropriate  for  its  descrip-
tors (although you retain the ability to withdraw use of the
effect altogether whenever you wish). Affects Others Only:
+0 cost per rank. Affects Others or yourself: +1 cost per rank.

Perception: Applied to a Ranged Affects Others Variable,
this extra allows you to grant the benefits of the effect to
any target you can accurately perceive. +1 cost per rank.

Ranged:  A Variable  effect  with  Affects  Others  may  have
the Ranged extra to improve the range at which you can
grant the effect to anoth

less than ideal conditions. This section details some of the
hazards heroes may face.

FALLING

Criminals  often  lurk  in  the  darkness,  and  many  crimes
take  place  at  night.  Most  cities  are  lit  well  enough,  but
sometimes  heroes  run  into  areas  where  it’s  difficult  to
see. Poorly lit areas provide concealment. Characters with
Counters Concealment (Darkness) Senses or other appro-
priate Senses effects can ignore concealment penalties for
poor lighting.

Intense  heat  and  cold  wear  down  characters,  while  pro-
longed exposure to the elements can be extremely dan-
gerous.

Characters in hot or cold conditions must make Fortitude
checks (DC 10, +1 per previous check) to avoid becoming
fatigued.  Fatigued  characters  who  fail  a  check  become
exhausted, then incapacitated, at which point the charac-
ter’s condition becomes dying after another failed Forti-
tude check.

How  often  characters  have  to  make  Fortitude  checks  de-
pends on the conditions. Once an hour for uncomfortable
heat or cold (a hot summer day or cold winter day), once
per 10 minutes for intense heat or cold (a blazing desert or
arctic conditions), once a minute for extreme heat or cold
like the edge of a volcano or an arctic winter storm. Checks
are made at the end of each period of exposure. Truly in-
tense heat or cold—such as a blast furnace or touching liq-
uid nitrogen—inflicts direct damage like an attack.

Characters with the appropriate Immunity do not need to
make Fortitude checks for extreme temperatures.

Heroes  can  go  without  water  for  a  day.  After  this,  they
need to make a Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous
check) each hour to avoid a level of fatigue. Heroes can go
without food for three days. After this, they must make a
Fortitude check (DC 10, +1 per previous check) each day
to  avoid  fatigue.  The  character  cannot  recover  until  he
gets  water  or  food.  Heroes  with  Immunity  to  Starvation
can go an unlimited time without food or water.

Characters can hold their breath for ten rounds (one min-
ute) plus a number of rounds equal to twice their Stamina.
After that time they must make a Fortitude check (DC 10)
each round to continue holding their breath. The DC in-
creases  by  +1  for  each  previous  success.  Failure  on  the
Fortitude  check  means  the  character  becomes  incapaci-
tated . On the following round the character is dying. A dy-
ing character cannot stabilize until

things  like  air  (or  other  gases),  water  (or
other  liquids),  and  earth  (soil,  rock,  sand,
etc.)  through  to  biological  materials  like
acids, blood, and so forth. Energy mediums
are different forms of energy, from electro-
magnetic (electricity, light, radio, radiation,
etc.) to gravity, kinetic energy, or an exotic
source like divine, magical, psionic, or cos-
mic  energy  (given  under  Origin  descrip-
tors).
RESULT

Lastly,  a  power’s  result  is  what  happens
when  the  power  is  used  beyond  just
the game mechanics of its effect. For
example, the rules of the Affliction ef-
fect  describe  the  penalties  suffered  by  the
target,  but  they  don’t  describe  the  result,
the nature of the Affliction itself. Is it glow-
ing  bonds  of  energy,  sudden  fever  and
dizziness,  a  curse  of  misfortune,  a  life-
sapping  vapor,  or  any  number  of  other
things?

Result descriptors tend to be fairly broad,
given  the  potential  range  of  results  avail-
able to effects in the game. Some powers
may  not  have  or  need  result  descriptors;
after  all, “Mind  Control”  is  a  pretty  clear
description  of  a  result.  However, “an  in-
duced  trance  where  the  human  brain
becomes  capable  of  accepting  neurolin-
guistic programming inputs” is also a valid
descriptor for that same effect.

Like medium descriptors, result descriptors
may or may not match others the power al-
ready has. Take a taser-like weapon able to
stun the nervous system of its target:
it has an invented origin (someone
designed  and  built  it),  a  techno-
logical source (it’s a technological
device with a battery), uses
a  energy  medium  (an
electrical  shock),  and
results  in  an  electrical
overload  of  the  tar-
get’s  nervous  system
(the  result  descriptor
for its Affliction effect).
This  tells  us  a  lot  about
that  particular  power  and
ways  it  might  interact  with  other
effects.

Applying descriptors to a power is as simple as describing
what the power is and how it works: “The divinely-granted
ability to heal through a laying-on of hands,” for example,
“or the mutant power to control magnetic fields to move

ferrous metal objects.” Considerably more evocative and
descriptive than “Healing effect” or “Move Object, Limited
to Ferrous Metals,” aren’t they?

Generally, you should feel free to apply whatever descrip-
tors seem appropriate and necessary to describe your char-
acter’s powers, so long as they don’t sig

manoids, animals, machines, and so forth. At rank 4 you
can assume any form of the same mass as your own.

For the ability to change size as well as appearance see the
Growth and Shrinking effects. To take on the other traits of
forms you assume, see the Metamorph extra, following, or
the Variable effect, later in this chapter.
EXTRAS

Attack:  A  Morph  Attack  imposes  a  different  appearance
on  the  target  creature.  Unlike  an  Affliction  that  imposes
the transformed condition, a Morph Attack is entirely cos-
metic: you can’t change the target’s traits other than ap-
pearance. +0 cost per rank.

Metamorph:  Morph  only  changes  your  appearance;  you
still  have  all  the  traits  of  your  normal  form. This  modifier
allows  you  to  have  an  alternate  set  of  traits,  essentially  a
complete  alternate  character  you  change  into,  one  set  of
traits per rank in Metamorph. You can switch between sets
of traits at will, once per round, as a free action. Your other
form(s) must have the same point total as you and are sub-
ject  to  the  same  power  level  limits. They  must  also  have
traits  suitable  to  your  Morph  effect.  For  example,  if  you
can only Morph into humanoid forms, then your alternate
forms all have to be humanoid. All of your forms must have
your full Morph effect as well; those power points cannot
be reallocated. The GM may require certain additional com-
mon traits for all of your forms, particularly mental abilities
and skills, if you retain them. Metamorph is best suited to
characters with defined sets of alternate traits. For a char-
acter able to transform into a virtually unlimited number of
forms with various traits, see the Variable effect later in this
chapter. Flat +1 point per rank of Metamorph.
FLAWS

Resistible: A Morph effect Resistible by Will is most likely
a mental illusion of some sort. Observers who succeed on
the Will  resistance  check  see  you  as  you  truly  are  rather
than in your Morph guise. This is in addition to the usual
Perception check to penetrate your disguise. If you have
the Metamorph extra, then targets that resist your effect
treat you as if you had your normal traits, and not those
granted by your Metamorph form. –1 cost per rank.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

•

•

Divine powers come from a higher being, essentially
a  god  or  gods.  Divine  power  is  generally  limited  to
the  god(s)  areas  of  influence  and  may  be  morally
aligned, available only to wielders with an allegiance
to that divinity.

Extradimensional  powers  originate  outside  the
home  dimension  of  the  setting,  from  other  planes
or dimensions of existence. Some extradimensional
powers  are  scientific  while  others  are  downright
mystical,  or  even  beyond  into  realms “man  was  not
meant to know.”

•

•

•  Magical powers draw upon magical energies, how-
ever they might be defined in the setting. Typically,
there  is  some  sort  of “magical  energy”  in  existence
that magicians and magical creatures draw upon for
their  powers  and  effects.  Note  that  powers  with  a
magical source are not necessarily “spells,” although
they might be; a dragon’s breath might use magic to
power it, or it might be biological, depending on the
descriptors applied to it (in other words, how it’s de-
fined in terms of the setting).

•  Moral  powers  come  from  an  abstract  morality  or
ideal,  essentially  from  an  allegiance  to  that  ideal.
Whether or not the moral power is aware and capa-
ble of interaction is up to the GM and the specifica-
tions of the setting; it’s the character’s belief in that
ideal that matters so far as the power is concerned.
“Good” and “evil” are common abstract moral sourc-
es of powers, but others may include chaos, law, an-
archy, order, justice, balance, neutrality, reason, and
so forth.

Psionic powers are powers of the mind, coming from
the psyche of the wielder (or perhaps from the Col-
lective  Unconscious,  which  acts  as  a “wellspring”  of
psionic power). This power source is associated with
classic “mental” powers like telepathy and telekinesis,
although effects like Mind Reading and Move Object
can also come from other sources.

Technological powers are the result of technology,
machines and technological devices. Although tech-
nological  power  sources  often  involve  Devices  or
Equipment, they don’t necessary have to; a techno-
logical  power  may  be  a  permanent  implant,  for  ex-
ample,  without  the  limitations  of  a  Device,  but  still
technological  (and  affected  by  things  keyed  to  the
technological descriptor).

MEDIUM

A power’s medium is what the power uses to accomplish its
effect(s). Often, a power’s source and me

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

In many instances, players come up with creative uses for their characters’ descriptors. This should be encouraged and,
generally speaking, allowed freely so long as those uses don’t spoil the game. So if a fire-using character wants to use
a tiny amount of his flame blast power to light some candles, or the electrical-controlling character wants to use some
of his power output to act as a living battery to jump-start a car, go for it. In the latter case you might want to call for a
Technology skill check to make sure the character gets the terminals and the voltage right, but most of the time it’s bet-
ter to just let the trick go through and give the character a chance to shine.

Creative uses of descriptors with no real game effect are freebies: no extra effort or hero points needed. Situations
where creative uses of descriptors have a significant game effect can be handled as power stunts: pick the effect that
best suits the desired outcome and treat it as an Alternate Effect of the power the hero wants to use, with descrip-
tors assigned as appropriate. If an electrical-controlling hero wants to use his power like a living defibrillator to save
a heart-attack victim, for example, that can be a Healing power stunt. The hero uses extra effort (and possibly a hero
point) and gets a one-shot use of Healing to stabilize the dying victim.

While  descriptors  are  generally  applied  to  powers  when
those  powers  are  defined  (that  is,  when  a  character  is
created),  in  some  cases,  certain  descriptors  may  be  left
unspecified  and  defined  during  play.  This  can  either  be
because nobody thought to define the descriptor in ad-
vance, or it was deliberately left vague, to be filled-in later.

So, for example, a particular heroine might not know the
origin or source of her powers, and her player doesn’t want
to know, leaving them a mystery for later development in
the game. The GM agrees and so the heroine’s powers have
no  origin  or  source  descriptors.  Instead,  the  GM  chooses
them, which isn’t known until the heroine is subject to an
anti-magical field and discovers her powers don’t work! The
GM awards the player a hero point for the unexpected set-
back and now the source of the heroine’s powers is known,
although their origin still remains a mystery….

Applying descriptors in play gives you a lot of flexibility,
letting you handle certain things “on the fly” rather than

CREATE

CONTROL

Action: Standard • Range: Ranged
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You  can  form  solid  objects  essentially  out  of  nowhere.
They may be made of solidified energy, “hardened” water
or  air,  transmuted  bulk  matter,  ice,  stone,  or  some  other
medium, depending on the effect’s descriptors.

You  can  form  any  simple  geometric  shape  or  common
object (such as a cube, sphere, dome, hammer, lens, disk,
etc.). The GM has final say on whether or not a particular
object  is  too  complex  for  this  effect.  Generally,  your  ob-
jects  can’t  have  any  moving  parts  more  complex  than  a
hinge. They can be solid or hollow, opaque or transparent,
as  you  choose  when  you  use  the  effect,  limited  by  your
descriptors and the Gamemaster’s judgment.

You  can  create  an  object  with  a  maximum  volume  rank
equal to your effect rank and Toughness equal to your ef-
fect rank. Created objects can be damaged or broken like
ordinary objects. They also vanish if you stop maintaining
them. You can repair any damage to a created object at will
by using your effect again (essentially “re-creating” the ob-
ject). Your created objects are stationary once you have cre-
ated them, although other effects can move them. Assume
a created object has a mass rank equal to its volume rank.
OBJECTS, COVER, AND CONCEALMENT

A created object can provide cover or concealment (if the
object is opaque) just like a normal object. Cover provided
by a created object can block incoming attacks, but blocks
outgoing attacks as well. Attacks hitting the covering ob-
ject  damage  it  normally  (see  Damaging  Objects,  page
244). Indirect effects can bypass the cover a created object
provides just like any other cover (see the Indirect modi-
fier). The Selective modifier allows you to vary the cover
and concealment your objects provide.

You can trap a target inside a large enough hollow ob-
ject (a cage or bubble, for example). This requires both
an attack check against the target’s Dodge and a Dodge
resistance  check  against  the  effect’s  rank.  A  trapped

HOOD: CREATE VS. SUMMON

Create  and  Summon  are  similar  effects:  both  “create”
things out of nowhere. So when should a character have
one and not the other?

pendent  action  (albeit  limited  in  the  case  of  mindless

Power Point Totals:  Abilities 50 + Powers 10  + Advantages 17 + Skills  45 + Defenses 28  = 150

ROOK

Jon  wants  to  create  a  hero  who’s  a  vigilante  type,  someone  with  no  superpowers,  but
great training and skill, along with various crime-fighting gadgets. The hero is intended for

a power level 10 game, with 150 starting power points.

Jon starts out with abilities. He wants his hero to be capable both physically and men-
tally. So he assigns rank 5 to both Agility and Dexterity to make his hero quick, ag-
ile, and accurate, and a 5 to Intellect to make him equally quick on the uptake. He
puts 3 each into Strength and Stamina making his hero well above average in those
abilities, but not quite as much as the others. Similarly, he gives his hero Presence 3
and Awareness 2, both above average, but not his strongest suits. Lastly, since he sees
his hero as a real combat expert, Jon gives him Fighting 8. Each ability rank costs 2 power

points, so Jon has spent 68 of his 150 points, just over a third.

Next, he looks at skills. He wants his hero to be quite skilled and makes a wish list of the skills he
wants. He starts out assigning 8 ranks to each of those skills—knowing skills
cost 1 power point per 2 ranks—but that would use up more than his re-
maining points! So he shifts those ranks around, decreasing less important
skills—like Sleight of Hand and Treatment—and increasing Ranged Com-
bat to match the hero’s Close Combat bonus. When he’s done, Jon has as-
signed 58 ranks in skills, quite a respectable amount, and spent 29 points
(58 ranks, divided by 2). That leaves him with 53 power points remaining.

Fortunately, Jon has decided his hero doesn’t really have any powers, relying
on skills, advantages, and equipment. So he turns to his character’s defenses. He
buys up his Dodge from 5 (for his Agility) to 14 for 9 points and his Parry from 8 (for
his Fighting) to 14 for 6 points. He increases Will from 2 (for his Awareness) to 8 for
another 6 points and gives his hero Fortitude 8, adding 5 points to his basic Stamina 3.

Jon has spent a total of (9 + 6 + 6 + 5) or 26 points on defenses, about half of what he has left.

Now he looks at his hero’s Toughness. Jon can’t increase that directly by spending power points; Tough-
ness can only be improved using advantages and powers, and his hero doesn’t have any powers. His hero
has Toughness 3 from his Stamina and his Toughness defense can be up to 6, given his Dodge

Of course, fame has its drawbacks, which include persis-
tent fans, greater public scrutiny, and things like constant
offers  for  product  endorsements  and  such.  Famous  he-
roes are more likely to be targeted by supervillains look-
ing to make a name for themselves or novice heroes want-
ing to join an established team. While the heroes are most
trusted  by  the  authorities,  they’re  also  more  likely  to  be
called upon in times of need.

On  the  other  hand,  heroes  may  also  become  infamous
for their deeds, particularly if they’re known to be ruth-
less or mercenary. Infamy may dog heroes with bad pub-
licity, whether or not they’re actually guilty of anything.
After enough “Threat or Menace?” editorials, people start
to  wonder  if  the  hero  really  is  a  good  guy.  Reversals  in
reputation and sudden infamy make for good complica-
tions.

HONORS

In  addition  to  fame  and  fortune,  heroes  may  receive  the
gratitude  of  the  people  they  help. They  get  awards  from
civic groups and organizations like the police and fire de-
partments. The mayor gives them the key to the city or ar-
ranges for a parade in their honor (or both). The governor or
President honors them on national television. Monuments
may  be  erected  in  their  honor  and  charitable  institutions
founded or dedicated in their names. A hero team’s trophy
room can contain various plaques, medals, and other acco-
lades right alongside captured criminal memorabilia.

An  awards  ceremony  makes  a  good  ending  to  an  adven-
ture or, perhaps, the beginning of one. After all, what villain
can resist so public a target as a hated enemy receiving an
award? And so you’re off creating your next adventure!

Run a few MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games and, before you know, you will have an ongoing series, just like a comic series
created by you and your players! While you can simply create and run adventures, it is often helpful to have a map of
roughly where your series is going, much like the outline of an adventure’s various encounters. This section looks at
creating your own M&M series and, in effect, your very own universe! The primary elements of your series to consider
are its scale, setting, and style.

SCALE

First, consider the scale of your series: will it focus primarily
on adventures taking place in and around a single city, or
will  the  heroes  travel  all  around  the  region  or  the  world?

RANGE

Each  effect  has  a  default  range,  which  may  be  changed
by modifiers.

•

•

•

•

•

Personal: The effect works only on you, the user.

Close: The effect can target anyone or anything you
touch. Touching an unwilling subject requires an un-
armed attack check against the subject’s Parry.

Ranged:  The  effect  works  at  a  distance,  limited  by
perception  and  path  and  requiring  a  ranged  attack
check against the subject’s Dodge defense. A ranged
effect has a short range of (rank x 25 feet), a medium
range  of  (rank  x  50  feet)  and  a  long  range  of  (rank
x 100 feet). Ranged attack checks at medium range
suffer  a  –2  circumstance  penalty,  while  ranged  at-
tacks at long range suffer a –5 circumstance penalty.
See the Action & Adventure chapter for details.

Perception: The effect works on any target you can
perceive  with  an  accurate  sense,  without  any  need
for an attack check. If you cannot accurately perceive
the target, you cannot affect it.

Rank:  The  effect’s  range  or  area  of  effect  is  deter-
mined by its rank, as given in its description.

DURATION

so.  If  you  are  incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  ac-
tion, or simply choose not to, the effect ends.

Sustained: You can keep a sustained effect going by
taking  a  free  action  each  round  to  do  so.  If  you  are
incapable  of  taking  the  necessary  action,  or  simply
choose not to, the effect ends.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Concentration:  Concentration  Move  Object  requires
more attention to maintain. You cannot concentrate to in-
crease your lifting capacity or to grab or move another ob-
ject while you are still “holding” your first. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Direction: You can only move objects in a par-
ticular direction or path, such as only up and down (to-
wards and away from the ground), only directly towards
or  away  from  you  (attraction  and  repulsion),  and  so
forth. This is useful for “gravitic” or “magnetic” versions of
the effect. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Material: You can only move a particular type of
object or material, such as only metals, plants, rock, water,
and so forth. –1 cost per rank (The GM may allow a –2 cost
per  rank  flaw  for  a  particularly  limited  type  of  material,
such as only precious metals, leaves, sand, or petroleum).

MOVEMENT

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 2 points per rank

You have a special form of movement. For each rank in this
effect, choose one of the following options:

You  can  move  instantly  from  one  dimension  to  another
as a move action. For 1 rank, you can move between your
home dimension and one other. For 2 ranks you can move
between  any  of  a  related  group  of  dimensions  (mystical
dimensions,  alien  dimensions,  etc).  For  3  ranks  you  can
travel to any dimension. You can carry up to 50 lbs. (mass
rank 0) of additional material with you when you move. If
you apply the Increased Mass modifier, you can carry ad-
ditional mass up to your modifier rank.

You’re  adapted  to  a  particular  environment,  such  as  un-
derwater,  zero  gravity,  and  so  forth  (see  Environmental
Hazards,  pages  185-187,  for  details). You  suffer  none  of
the normal unfavorable circumstance or movement pen-
alties associated with that environment, moving and act-
ing normally. You are still affected by environmental haz-
ards like suffocation, exposure, and so forth. You need the
Immunity effect to ignore such things.

PERMEATE

You  can  pass  through  solid  objects  as  if  they  weren’t
there. For 1 rank, you can move at speed rank –2 through
any physical object. For 2 ranks, you can move at speed
rank –1 and for 3 ranks, you move at your normal speed
through  any  obstacles. You  cannot  breathe  while  com-
pletely  inside  a  solid  object,  so  you  either  need  Im-
munity to Suffocation or have to hold your breath. You

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

149

Spread throughout this section are boxes like this one,
providing  examples  of  some  of  the  most  common
powers  found  amongst  superhero  characters  to  give
you a “menu” of pre-fabricated powers to choose from
when  creating  your  own  heroes  (and  villains)  in  MU-
MASTERMINDS.  Sample  powers  are  presented  on
the Power Effects table in italics.

Each power is presented in the following format:

NAME

Effect(s): Modifier(s) • Cost

Name: What the power is called. Feel free to mod-
ify the name to suit how you’re using the power.

Effects: The power’s effect or effects are listed by
name.

Modifiers:  Any  modifiers  applying  to  the  effect
are  listed  with  it.  If  a  power  has  multiple  effects,
each is listed with its applicable modifiers.

Cost: Lastly, the power’s cost is given. This is a cost
per rank of the power if it has a ranked effect, oth-
erwise it is a flat cost in power points. Some pow-
ers may have a flat cost for the initial power, plus a
cost per rank for additional ranks.

Effect: Varies, Activation • effects total –1 or 2 points

isting degrees on the target. For example, if you hit a target
and impose a vulnerable condition (one degree), then at-
tack again and get one degree on the effect, you impose
the Affliction’s second degree condition. +1 cost per rank.

Extra  Condition:  Your  Affliction  imposes  an  additional
condition per degree of success. So with one application of
this extra, your Affliction imposes two conditions—such as
dazed  and  hindered,  or  impaired  and  vulnerable—rather
than just one. With two applications, it imposes three con-
ditions,  and  so  forth.  Since  mutually  incompatible  condi-
tions  are  largely  wasted,  Afflictions  with  this  extra  often
have the Limited Degree flaw as well. +1 cost per rank.

Progressive: This modifier causes an Affliction to increase
incrementally  without  any  effort  from  you.  If  the  target
fails  a  resistance  check  to  end  the  Affliction,  it  not  only
persists, but increases in effect by one degree! So a target
affected by the first degree of a Progressive Affliction who
fails to resist progresses to the second degree of the effect
at the start of his next round. A successful resistance check
still ends the Affliction, as usual. +2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Instant Recovery: Similar to the Reversible extra (see p.
196),  the  target  of  an  Affliction  effect  with  this  modifier
recovers  automatically,  no  c

Identity:  Some  Powerhouses  keep  their  identity  a

Powerhouses  that  can  change  into  and  out  of  their
super-powered identity.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Those  Powerhouses  with
the  Prejudice  complication  often  choose  this  mo-
tivation  and  become  a  hero  in  order  to  earn  a  place
in  “normal”  society.  An  alien  Powerhouse  may  also
choose this motivation even if he or she doesn’t look
unusual.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  Many  Powerhouses  are
die-hard  patriots  and  fight  to  defend  or  represent
their country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: Due to their incredible
powers, many Powerhouses become heroes because
they feel as if they have a responsibility to do so.

ledge, tumbling through obstacles, and so forth. The GM
sets the DC. Success means you accomplish the maneu-
ver,  while  failure  means  you  do  not,  and  two  or  more
degrees  of  failure  usually  means  you  slip  and  end  up
prone (and may suffer additional effects, depending on
the stunt). A successful acrobatic maneuver may provide
you a circumstance bonus on certain follow-up actions,
if the GM sees fit.

STANDING

You can make a DC 20 Acrobatics check to go from prone
to standing as a free action rather than a move action. A
failed check means you remain prone.

TUMBLING

You can make an Acrobatics check (DC 5) to lessen dam-
age from a fall, reducing the damage by 1 per degree. A
fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you
quickly roll to your feet as a free action. Otherwise, you are
prone at the end of a fall.

ATHLETICS

Use Athletics for physical feats like climbing, jumping, rid-

CLIMBING

With a successful Athletics check, you can climb along a
slope,  wall,  or  other  steep  incline  at  your  ground  speed
rank minus 2 as a move action. A perfectly smooth, flat,
vertical surface can’t be climbed without the Wall-crawl-
ing effect of Movement (see the Powers chapter).

A failed Athletics check indicates you make no progress,
and  two  or  more  degrees  of  failure  means  you  fall  from
whatever  height  you  attained  (unless  you  are  secured
with a safety harness or other equipment). Make an Ath-

the  round  in  which  the  duration  ends.  So,  for  example,
an instant duration Affliction only lasts one round, while
a  sustained  duration  Affliction  lasts  until  no  longer  sus-
tained. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Degree: Your Affliction is limited to no more than
two degrees of effect. With two applications of this modi-
fier, it is limited to no more than one degree of effect. –1
cost per rank.

BURROWING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel be-
hind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a
speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Bur-
rowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground
at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard
clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank.
Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional
ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or
collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you
begin burrowing each new tunnel).

Note  that  Burrowing  differs  from  the  Permeate  effect  of
Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle
like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing
it at all (see Movement for details).
EXTRAS

Penetrating:  Normally,  the  hardness  of  the  ground  af-
fects  only  the  speed  at  which  you  burrow.  At  the  GM’s
discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered
Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows
you to dig through them. 1 point per rank.

Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a
greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of
the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Oth-
ers, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone
else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of
the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Limited:  Burrowing  may  be  limited  to  certain  circum-
stances  or  materials,  such  as  only  loose  sand  and  soil

BLAST

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You  can  make  a  damaging  ranged  attack.  It  might  be
a  blast  of  energy,  a  projectile  (arrow,  bullet,  throwing
blade, etc.), or some similar effect. You make a ranged
attack  check  against  the  target’s  Dodge  defense.  The
attack’s damage equals your power rank and the target
makes a Toughness resistance check against it.

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

using the device beyond that, he must pay power points
to make the device part of his regular abilities. Otherwise
the GM can simply rule that the device is lost, reclaimed
by its owner, runs out of power, breaks down, or whatever,
and is therefore no longer accessible. Characters with the
Inventor  and  Artificer  advantages  can  create  temporary
devices for use in an adventure.

Gamemasters  may  require  characters  to  spend  a  hero
point to make temporary use of a device that doesn’t be-
long to them, similar to performing a power stunt without
suffering fatigue. This helps to limit the loaning and tem-
porary use of devices.

A  common  staple  of  comic  books  is  the  battlesuit,  also
known  as  power-armor.  It  is  an  advanced  suit  of  tech-
nological  (sometime  magical)  armor,  giving  the  wearer
various powers. Battlesuits commonly grant the following
powers:

•

•

•

Armor:  Protection  is  the  foundation  power  for  a
battlesuit. Whether it is armor plating, metallic mesh,
flexible  ballistic  material,  or  some  combination  of
these and other cutting-edge technologies, a battle-
suit  protects  its  wearer  from  damage.  Some  battle-
suits provide Impervious Protection and some have
Sustained  Protection  in  the  form  of  built-in  force
fields or the like.

Attacks:  Battlesuits  are  typically  equipped  with
some kind of weapon or weapons, based around var-
ious attack effects, particularly Damage. A battlesuit
with an array of weapons may have a primary attack
effect and several others as Alternate Effects (see the
Alternate Effect modifier in the Powers chapter).

Immunity: A part of the protection a battlesuit offers
is  a  sealed  environment,  offering  Immunity  to  vari-
ous conditions and hazards.

•  Movement:  After  defense  and  offense,  battlesuits
typically allow the wearer to get around, whether it’s
hydraulic-assisted  Leaping,  boot-jets  or  anti-gravity
repulsion for Flight, turbines for Swimming, or some

other movement effect.

•

Sensors:  Battlesuits  often  come
equipped with a suite of sensors providing
Senses. Darkvision, direction sense (pos-
sibly from a global positioning system),
infrared vision, radio, time sense (from
a  chronometer),  and  ultra-hearing  are
all common battlesuit sensors.

•  Strength: A battlesuit might have ser-
vomotors  or  other  mechanisms  to  mag-
nify  the  wearer’s  Strength. This  is  typically  a
combination of Enhanced Stren

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-

to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

* = See individual descriptions for more information.

Trucks  include  pick-ups,  sport  utility
vehicles (SUVs), vans, and similarly
sized vehicles.

Tanks are heavily armed
and  armored  vehicles.
The standard tank has
Tough-
Impervious
ness  12  and  comes
equipped  with  a  can-
non  (Ranged  Damage  10,
Burst Area 6) and a heavy machine
gun (Ranged Multiattack Damage 6). It
takes a move action to get into or out
of a  tank, and another move action
to start it up.

APCs or Armored Personnel Car-
riers,  are  designed  for  carry-
ing  troops.  They  come  with
a  smaller  cannon  (Ranged
Damage  6,  Burst  Area  4),
Impervious  Toughness  8,
and are set up so soldiers on
board can fire their personal
weapons  from  behind  the
cover of the APC’s armor.

Water vehicles range from small boats and outboards to
massive sea-going ships.

Cutters are used by the Coast Guard and the Navy. They’re
often equipped with light machine guns (Ranged Multiat-
tack Damage 6).

Destroyers  are  main  naval  ships,  carrying  heavy  guns
(Ranged Damage 10, Burst Area 8).

Battleships have massive gun batteries (Ranged Damage
13, Burst Area 9) and heavy armor.

Submarines are equipped with torpedoes (Ranged Dam-
age  8,  Burst  Area  5)  and  often  ballistic  missiles  (Ranged
Burst  Area  Damage  15  or  higher,  not  included  in  listed
cost).

Air vehicles are all capable of flight, some of them at very
high speeds.

Military  helicopters  are  equipped  with  machine  guns
(Ranged  Multiattack  Damage  6)  and  rockets  (Ranged
Damage 9, Burst Area 6).

Fighter  jets  have  machine  guns  (Ranged  Multiattack
Damage  6)  and  air-to-air  missiles  (Ranged  Damage  11,
Burst Area 8, Homing 6).

Bombers may have machine guns and missiles, but also
have powerful bombs (Burst Area Damage 12 or higher)
they can drop on targets.

Space  vehicles  are  intended  for  use  outside  the  atmo-
sphere, some of them for interplanetary or even interstel-
lar travel. Generally space vehicles are found in the pos-
session of alien civilizations, although the GM may choose
to allow some organizations and individuals on Earth to
have space vehicles.

Space fighters are armed with blaster cannons (Ranged
Damage 10).

Space cruisers have larger beam weapons (Ranged Dam-
age 12) and often energy torpedoes (Ranged Damage 12,
Burst Area 10, Homing 8).

Space  battleships  have  the  most  massive  weapons:

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

MOVEMENT

Movement effects allow characters to get around in vari-
ous  ways.  Some  provide  a  speed  rank  with  a  particular
form of movement—such as ground, air, or water—while
others offer different modes of movement, like walking on
walls or slithering along the ground like a snake.

Although  activating  a  movement  effect  is  typically  a  free
action, the character must still take a move action in order
to actually move using the effect. So, for example, the ac-
tion of the Flight effect is “free” and activating it grants the
character a Flight speed rank equal to the effect rank. Mov-
ing that speed rank still requires a move action, however.

SENSORY

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  grouped  into  sense
types, descriptors for how different sensory effects work. The
sense types, and some of the senses included in them, are:

•

•

•

•

•

Visual: normal sight, darkvision, infravision, low-light
vision, microscopic vision, ultravision, X-Ray vision

Auditory: normal hearing, sonar (accurate ultrason-
ic), ultrasonic hearing

Olfactory: normal smell and taste, scent

Tactile: normal touch, tremorsense

Radio: radio, radar (accurate radio)

•  Mental: mental awareness, Mind Reading, Precogni-

Sensory effects enhance or alter the senses. Some senso-
ry effects improve the user’s senses while others grant en-
tirely new senses or fool the senses in some way. Sensory
effects are typically a free action to activate and sustain, or
are permanent and always in effect.

•

tion, Postcognition

Special: This is the catchall for other sensory descrip-
tors  not  given  above,  including  unusual  senses  or
exotic descriptors like cosmic, gravitic, magical, and
so forth.

Using  powers  is  a  fairly  simple  matter.  Some  power  effects  work  automatically.  Others—particularly  those  affecting
other people—require some effort to use, like an attack check or a effect check. Powers affecting others allow resistance
checks against their effects.

In  some  cases,  you  may  be  required  to  make  an  effect
check  to  determine  how  well  an  effect  works.  A  power
check  is  just  like  any  other  check:  d20,  plus  the  power’s
rank,  plus  any  applicable  modifiers,  against  a  difficulty
class set by the Gamemaster. The results of various power
checks are described in this chapter.

Effect Check = d20 + rank +
modifiers vs. difficulty class

MIMIC

The Mimic copies the traits of others to use as his own. This
affords  him  immense  versatility,  limited  primarily  by  the

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Effect: Ranged, Progressive Affliction, Resisted by Forti-
tude • 4 points per rank

You  render  the  target  unable  to  breathe.  Targets  fail-
ing  the  Fortitude  resistance  check  against  your  effect
DC become dazed, stunned, and finally incapacitated,
passing out from the lack of oxygen. A failed attempt
to  resist  the  ongoing  effect  of  Suffocation  causes  the
target’s condition to worsen by one degree.

ent than “heat ray” is a descriptor for a Damage effect or
“sticky webbing” is a descriptor for a hindering Affliction;
in  neither  case  does  the  character  need  Summon  Heat
Ray or Summon Webbing to create the desired powers!

SWIMMING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can swim fast. You have a water speed equal to your
Swimming  rank  –2,  subject  to  the  usual  rules  for  swim-
ming (see the Athletics skill description for details). You
can make Athletics checks to swim as routine checks. This
power does not allow you to breathe underwater (for that
see Immunity, page 165).

TELEPORT

MOVEMENT

Action: Move • Range: Rank
Duration: Instant • Cost: 2 points per rank

You can move instantly from place to place without cross-
ing the distance in between. You can teleport yourself and
up  to  50  lbs.  (mass  rank  0)  of  additional  mass  a  distance
rank equal to your effect rank as a move action. Unwilling
passengers  get  a  Dodge  resistance  check  to  avoid  being
taken along.

You can only teleport to places you can accurately sense
or know especially well (in the GM’s judgment). You re-
tain  your  position  and  relative  velocity  when  you  tele-
port. So if you are falling when you teleport, you are still
falling at the same speed when you arrive at your desti-
nation.

Teleport is meant for use on or around a planet. For things
like traveling to distant planets or stars, apply the Space
Travel  effect  of  Movement  as  a  “hyperjump”  or  similar
power.
EXTRAS

Accurate: You don’t need to know or accurately sense your
destination to teleport there, just be able to generally de-
scribe it, such as “inside the capitol building lobby” or “atop
the  Emerald  Tower’s  roof.”  If  the  destination  isn’t  in  your
Teleport range, nothing happens. +1 cost per rank.

SUPER-SPEED

Effect: Enhanced Initiative, Quickness, Speed • 3 points

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

245

A successful attack has some effect on the target. Typical-
ly this is an effect from the Powers chapter, such as Dam-
age or Affliction. The effect has a rank, used to determine
a difficulty class for the target’s resistance check.

Resistance Difficulty = effect rank + 10

The target of the attack makes a resistance check against
the effect to determine what, if anything, happens.

Some  effects  are  not  resisted  just  once,  but  multiples
times. The later resistance checks represent how fast the
target is able to “shake off” the effect. Make a resistance
check  for  the  target  of  an  ongoing  effect  at  the  end  of
each  of  the  target’s  turns.  A  successful  check  ends  the
effect  and  removes  conditions  imposed  by  it.  A  failure
means  the  effect’s  conditions  persist,  as  given  in  the  ef-
fect’s description.

Example: Captain Thunder was hit by a Affliction
effect, leaving him blinded. At the end of his turn,
he makes a Fortitude resistance check against the
effect’s  DC  to  try  and  shake  it  off,  but  missed  the
check  by  2.  His  next  turn,  still  blind,  he  stumbles
and tries to strike the foe taunting him. At the end
of his turn, he makes another resistance check. Suc-
cess! He ends the Affliction effect and removes the
blinded condition. Next turn, the villain had better
watch out!

A  failed  resistance  check  against  an  attack  imposes  one
or more conditions on the target, depending on the type
of effect and the degree of failure. See the effect descrip-
tion and the Conditions section of The Basics chapter for
more on the various conditions.

ACTIONS

The  most  common  actions  characters  take  during  con-
flicts  are  listed  and  described  here.  The  GM  should  use
these as guidelines for dealing with unusual actions play-
ers may choose for their characters, basing them on the
existing action descriptions.

AID

If you are in position to attack an opponent, you can at-
tempt to aid an ally engaged in melee with that oppo-
nent as a standard action. This is like a team check (see
Team  Checks  in  The  Basics  chapter): You  make  an  at-
tack check against DC 10. If you succeed, you don’t actu-
ally hit or affect the opponent, but success grants your
ally  gains  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  on  an  attack  check
against  that  opponent  or  a  +2  circumstance  bonus  to

Defense  against  that  opponent  (your  choice)  until  the
end  of  your  ally’s  next

Identity:  Some  Powerhouses  keep  their  identity  a
secret  from  the  rest  of  the  world.  Especially  those
Powerhouses  that  can  change  into  and  out  of  their
super-powered identity.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Those  Powerhouses  with
the  Prejudice  complication  often  choose  this  mo-
tivation  and  become  a  hero  in  order  to  earn  a  place
in  “normal”  society.  An  alien  Powerhouse  may  also
choose this motivation even if he or she doesn’t look
unusual.

•  Motivation—Patriotism:  Many  Powerhouses  are
die-hard  patriots  and  fight  to  defend  or  represent
their country.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: Due to their incredible
powers, many Powerhouses become heroes because
they feel as if they have a responsibility to do so.

•

Power  Loss:  Some  Powerhouses  lose  their  powers
in the presence of a certain substance, while others
physically transform from a normal human form and
return to it often.

Prejudice: The Powerhouse often looks unusual and
struggles with feeling isolated or like an outsider, or
even being treated like a monster!

Relationship: The Powerhouse typically has a small
group of friends he or she relies on for human con-
tact and friendship. These relationships are very im-
portant to the Powerhous

the  round  in  which  the  duration  ends.  So,  for  example,
an instant duration Affliction only lasts one round, while
a  sustained  duration  Affliction  lasts  until  no  longer  sus-
tained. –1 cost per rank.

Limited Degree: Your Affliction is limited to no more than
two degrees of effect. With two applications of this modi-
fier, it is limited to no more than one degree of effect. –1
cost per rank.

BURROWING

MOVEMENT

Action: Free • Range: Personal
Duration: Sustained • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can burrow through the ground, leaving a tunnel be-
hind if you choose. You move through soil and sand at a
speed rank equal to your Burrowing rank, minus 5. So Bur-
rowing 8, for example, lets you move through the ground
at speed rank 3 (around 16 MPH). Burrowing through hard
clay and packed earth reduces speed one additional rank.
Burrowing through solid rock reduces it by two additional
ranks. The tunnel you leave behind is either permanent or
collapses behind you immediately (your choice when you
begin burrowing each new tunnel).

Note  that  Burrowing  differs  from  the  Permeate  effect  of
Movement, which allows you to pass through an obstacle
like the ground at your normal speed without disturbing
it at all (see Movement for details).
EXTRAS

Penetrating:  Normally,  the  hardness  of  the  ground  af-
fects  only  the  speed  at  which  you  burrow.  At  the  GM’s
discretion, some super-hard materials may be considered
Impervious to Burrowing, in which case this extra allows
you to dig through them. 1 point per rank.

Ranged: This extra either allows you to create tunnels at a
greater distance (without having to be at the end-point of
the tunnel as it forms) or, in conjunction with Affects Oth-
ers, allows you to grant the Burrowing effect to someone
else at a distance. Doing both requires two applications of
the extra. +1 or 2 cost per rank.

FLAWS

Limited:  Burrowing  may  be  limited  to  certain  circum-
stances  or  materials,  such  as  only  loose  sand  and  soil

BLAST

Effect: Ranged Damage • 2 points per rank

You  can  make  a  damaging  ranged  attack.  It  might  be
a  blast  of  energy,  a  projectile  (arrow,  bullet,  throwing
blade, etc.), or some similar effect. You make a ranged
attack  check  against  the  target’s  Dodge  defense.  The
attack’s damage equals your power rank and the target
makes a Toughness resistance check against it.

Sitting  on  top  of  the  criminal  underworld  are  the  crime
lords. These are men and women who’ve come up through
the ranks and now run the show. Physically a crime lord
is  no  match  for  a  hero,  but  their  connections,  resources,
and  knowledge  of  the  underworld  can  be  problematic.
The crime lord presented here is a fairly small fish; Game-
masters should make any changes needed to increase the
crime lord’s power and influence for the series.

The Elementals described here generally have traits such as Insubstantial default to Permanent. However, some elemen-
tals may be able to transform between their elemental and a flesh and blood form. Such elementals may have Sustained
powers and possibly the Activation Flaw if the transformation takes time or effort. In this case, the Activation Flaw can free
up a point that the player can spend on an additional Alternate Effect or Advantage.

Alternately, the elementals who are considered Embodiments (as rolled on the Abilities) may have Innate forms that can-
not be turned off even by nullification effects. Players may wish to take a point from another trait (such as an Alternate
Effect or Advantage) to buy the Innate Extra.

•  Motivation—Acceptance: The Construct often feels
like  an  outsider,  either  because  it’s  not  human  and
wants to be, or used to be human and wants to be
again. Regardless, the Construct is a hero because it
wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity.

•  Motivation—Doing Good: An artificial intelligence or
magically created Construct may have been created to
“do good” and pursues that goal to the best of its ability.

•  Motivation—Justice:  A  revenant  or  ghost-pos-
sessed Construct may recall enough of its former life
to  be  on  the  prowl  for  revenge  against  the  specific
people that killed it, or against all members of groups
with similar motivations.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Construct may feel
that its powers and abilities were given to it for a rea-
son, so it has a responsibility to help however it can.

•

•

Enemy:  The  Construct  could  be  a  rogue  android,
golem,  or  summoned  elemental  hunted  by  its
creator(s)  or  another  person  or  group  who  believes
the Construct is evil for some reason.

*These numbers are for the Summoner only; for the Du-
plicator,  use  the  totals  listed  for  the  appropriate Twin  or
Triplets, then add the points for the Summon power.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  The  Summoner  has  un-
usual abilities that make him or her an outsider. He or
she uses those powers to gain acceptance.

•  Motivation—Doing  Good:  Some  Summoners  are
heroes because they believe it’s the right thing to do.

•  Motivation—Responsibility:  With

the  powers
they’ve  been  given,  some  Summoners  believe  it’s
their responsibility to help others.

•  Motivation—Thrills:  Outside  of  their  Summon
ability, many Summoners don’t have a lot of powers.
Some may find the constant threat of danger to be a
bit much, but not this Summoner! The more danger,
the better!

•

•

Power Loss: Summoners may need to speak or move
their  hands  in  order  to  summon  their  minion(s).
When these Summoners are bound and/or gagged,
they lose their powers.

Relationship: A Summoner may have friends or fam-
ily to whom he’s responsible—but it may be that the
Summoner needs to keep his summoned creature(s)
happy as well. The Summoner may have Controlled
minions,  but  that  doesn’t  mean  he  can  be  mean  to
them and still expect them to show up!

Secret: The Summoner’s minions and abilities come
from  somewhere;  what  if  their  origin  is  particularly
dark or dangerous? The Summoner would certainly
want to keep that secret private as long as possible.

Supernatural Creatures are fantastical beings out of folk-
tales and scary stories. They’re generally regarded as ur-

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

29

A lot of background details go into making your hero more than just a collection of numbers. Take a moment (if you
haven’t already) to consider some of the following things about your character:

NAME

What is your character’s name? That is to say, what is the
name  the  hero  uses  in  public,  that  appears  in  one-inch
type  in  the  newspaper  headlines?  Most  heroes  adopt
unique  and  distinctive “code  names,”  so  consider  a  suit-
able name for yours. Code names are often based on pow-
ers, theme, or style. Here are some options to consider:
ORIGIN

A name may be based on the hero’s origin, power source,
nation (or even world) of birth, and such.
POWERS

Choose a name based on the hero’s powers: Firestarter or
Blaze for a flame-controlling character, Thunder or Spark
for an electrical character, and so forth.

THEME

Maybe  the  character  has  a  theme  or  style  suggesting  a
name: Paladin might be a medieval knight displaced into
the present day, with a magical sword and armor. Madame
Macabre may be all about magic and the occult.

TITLES

Names  may  include  various  titles  like  Mister,  Miss,  Ms.,
Doctor,  Sir,  Lord,  Lady,  and  Madam  or  even  royal  titles
like  King,  Queen,  Prince,  Princess,  Duke,  Baron,  Emperor
and so forth. Military ranks are also popular parts of hero
names, especially General, Major, and Captain.
GENDER

Names often include gender designations like Man/Wom-
an, Boy/Girl, Lad/Lass, and so forth.
SOUND

Some  code-names  don’t  really  have  anything  to  do  with  a
character’s powers or background—they just sound cool: Kis-
met, Scion, Animus, Damask, and so forth. They may hint at
the hero’s powers or origin, or have nothing to do with them.

REAL NAME

Some heroes go by their given name, not using a code-
name at all. Oftentimes these names still sound like code-

names,  however.  They  may  also  be  nicknames,  such  as
“Dash” for someone with the name Dashell, or “Buzz” for
someone  with  the  name  Buzcinski,  or  whatever  other
nickname a character may have, such as “Stretch” or “Tiny”.

ORIGIN

What’s  the  origin  of  your  hero’s  powers?  It  can  be  any-
thing from a character born with the potential for powers
to someone granted them by an accident—exposure to a
strange meteor, radiation, genetic engineering, or any of
countless similar encounters. Here are some of the more
common superhero origins:

Perhaps  the  most  common  origin. The  hero

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Example:  Captain  Thunder  has  the  ability  to  hurl
thunderbolts  that  shock  their  targets  with  electric-
ity and deafen them with powerful claps of thunder.
This  is  a  Ranged  Damage  effect  (lightning),  cost-
ing 2 points per rank, Linked to a Ranged Affliction
(deafening thunder), costing 2 points per rank. The
combined effect costs 4 points per rank.Since both
effects  are  ranged  and  require  a  standard  action
to use, so does the combined effect. Since Damage
requires a Toughness check and Affliction requires a
Dodge check, the target checks against them sepa-
rately, making a Toughness resistance check against
the damage of the lightning and a Dodge check to
avoid being deafened by the thunder. Since the two
effects are Linked, Captain Thunder cannot throw a
lightning  bolt  without  the  deafening  thunderclap,
nor can he attempt to merely deafen a target with-
out  also  hitting  them  with  lightning!  (To  do  these
things,  Cap  might  take  the  stand-alone  effects  as
Alternate Effects.)

+1 COST PER RANK

A Multiattack effect allows you to hit multiple targets, or a
single target multiple times, in the same standard action.
Multiattack  can  apply  to  any  effect  requiring  an  attack
check. There are three ways in which a Multiattack effect
can be used:

To  use  a  Multiattack  against  a  single  target,  make  your
attack check normally. If successful, increase the attack’s
resistance check DC by +2 for two degrees of success, and
+5  for  three  or  more. This  circumstance  bonus  does  not
count against power level limits.

If  an  Impervious  Resistance  would  ignore  the  attack  be-
fore any increase in the DC, then the attack still has no ef-
fect as usual; a volley of multiple shots is no more likely to
penetrate Impervious Resistance than just one.

You can use Multiattack to hit multiple targets at once by
“walking” or “spraying” the Multiattack across an arc. Roll
one  attack  check  per  target  in  the  arc. You  suffer  a  pen-
alty to each check equal to the total number of targets. So
making a Multiattack against five targets is a –5 penalty
to each attack check. If you miss one target, you may still
attempt to hit the others.

cally  attacked  by  it;  make  a  normal  attack  check  to  hit

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

185

Powers  based  off  the Variable  effect  are  obviously  very  flexible,  capable  of  duplicating  a  wide  range  of  other  effects.
Responsibility for controlling Variable effects in the game is placed largely in the hands of both the Gamemaster and
responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with numerous game-system limitations
that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of effects.

Keep in mind a Variable effect is not supposed to be “any effect I want.” That kind of unlimited power doesn’t belong in the
hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A Variable effect can be “any effect within a
given set of parameters,” but it’s up to you and the GM to define those parameters. The limits of power flexibility in MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS are deliberately set by Variable effects, the use of extra effort, and hero points.

Many  comic  book  heroes  who  appear  to  have  the  power  to “do  anything”  are  actually  using  one  of  these  options  in
terms.  For  example,  a  super-wizard  can  do  practically  anything  with  magic.  However,  generally
speaking, these characters have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with power points) and
“stunts” they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly hero points).
This is why the Magic power given later in this chapter, for example, is not a Variable effect: most powers in the game
have the potential to do “stunts” via extra effort, so the “variability” of Magic seen in the comics is already built-in to the
system, with some costs to control it, without having to give players carte blanche to duplicate any effect in the game at
will (which is just likely to slow things down and cause game balance issues).

Variable effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and define everything about a given power in
advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an application of the Morph effect with a long
list of Metamorph options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at a time, would be tedious to say the
least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A Variable effect, with the descriptor “animal
forms” is easier to manage. The player can pre-build certain commonly used animal forms for use during play, but also ha

LITERACY

Characters are assumed to be literate in their native language and any other language they know. At the GM’s discretion,
characters may have to spend an additional Languages rank to be literate in a language with a different alphabet or style
of writing from the character’s native language (such as Arabic, Japanese kanji or Russian Cyrillic for an English speaker).
Completely illiterate characters are faced with a potential Disability complication during the game.

level limits, like other uses of hero points. Multiple uses of
Inspire do not stack, only the highest bonus applies.

JACK-OF-ALL-TRADES

SKILL

GENERAL

You can go from prone to standing as a free action with-
out the need for an Acrobatics skill check.

INTERPOSE

GENERAL

Once  per  round,  when  an  ally  within  range  of  your  nor-
mal movement is hit by an attack, you can choose to place
yourself between the attacker and your ally as a reaction,
making  you  the  target  of  the  attack  instead. The  attack
hits  you  rather  than  your  ally,  and  you  suffer  the  effects
normally. You cannot use this advantage against area ef-
fects or perception range attacks, only those requiring an
attack check.

INVENTOR

SKILL

You can use the Technology skill to create inventions. See
Inventing, page 211, for details.

You can use any skill untrained, even skills or aspects of
skills  that  normally  cannot  be  used  untrained,  although
you must still have proper tools if the skill requires them.

LANGUAGES

SKILL, RANKED

You  can  speak  and  understand  additional  languages.
With one rank in this advantage, you know an additional
language. For each additional rank, you double your ad-
ditional  known  languages:  two  at  rank  2,  four  at  rank  3,
eight at rank 4, etc. So a character with Languages 7 is flu-
ent in 64 languages! Characters are assumed to be fluent
in any languages they know, including being able to read
and write in them.

For the ability to understand any language, see the Com-
prehend effect in the Powers chapter.

DAMAGE

ATTACK

Action: Standard • Range: Close
Duration: Instant • Cost: 1 point per rank

You can inflict damage on a target by making a close at-
tack. The exact nature of your Damage is up to you, with
the GM’s approval; it can be anything from a powerful im-
pact to razor claws, energy fields, or some other damaging
medium. The target resists with Toughness:

Toughness vs. [Damage rank + 15]

Success : The damage has no effect.

Failure (one degree): The target has a –1 circumstance
penalty to further resistance checks against damage.

Failure (two degrees): The target is dazed until the end
of their next turn and has a –1 circumstance penalty to
further checks against damage.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  staggered
and  has  a  -1  circumstance  penalty  to  further  checks
against damage. If the target is staggered again (three
degrees of failure on a Damage resistance check), ap-
ply  the  fourth  degree  of  effect. The  staggered  condi-
tion  remains  until  the  target  recovers  (see  Recovery,
following).

Failure (four degrees): The target is incapacitated .

The  circumstance  penalties  to Toughness  checks  are  cu-
mulative,  so  a  target  who  fails  three  resistance  checks
against  Damage,  each  with  one  degree  of  failure,  has  a
total –3 penalty.

If an incapacitated target fails a resistance check against
Damage, the target’s condition shifts to dying. A dying tar-
get who fails a resistance check against Damage is dead.

Strength provides a “built-in” Damage effect: the ability
to hit things! You can apply effect modifiers to the Dam-
age your Strength inflicts, making it Penetrating or even
an  Area  effect!  You  can  also  have  Alternate  Effects  for
your Strength Damage; see the Alternate Effect modi-
fier  for  details.  Like  other  Damage  effects,  a  character’s
Strength Damage is close range and instant duration by
default.

If  you  choose,  a  Damage  effect  can  be  Strength-
based—something like a melee weapon—allowing your
Strength Damage to add to it. You add your Strength and
Damage  ranks  together  when  determining  the  rank  of
the attack. Any modifiers applied to your Damage must
also apply to your Strength rank if its bonus damage is
to  benefit  from  them.  However,  any  decrease  in  your
Strength reduces the amount you can add to your Dam-
age, and negative Strength subtracts from your Damage!
Likewise, anything that prevents you from exerting your

is one degree of success, just as a result of 8 is one degree
of failure.

There is no limit to the number of degrees a check may have,
although more than two degrees of failure rarely matters,
and some degrees of success may have no further effect be-
yond a certain point (once you have succeeded as well as
is possible in a given situation). For example, failure on an
Acrobatics check to balance means you wobble and spend
that  turn  maintaining  your  balance,  but  don’t  move. Two
degrees of failure mean you lose your balance and fall! After
that point, further degrees of failure don’t really matter.

In cases where a single degree of success or failure is suffi-
cient, the rules simply specify “success” or “failure” without
giving a degree.

Specific types of graded checks—notably skill and resis-
tance checks—give specific results for degrees of success
and failure in their descriptions.

Some circumstances make checks easier or harder, result-
ing in a bonus or penalty to the check. Characters in a fa-
vorable situation are said to have a circumstance bonus
for the check, while those in a disadvantageous situation
are said to be have a circumstance penalty.

As  a  general  rule,  apply  a  modifier  of  plus  or  minus  2  if
the character is at a minor bonus or minor penalty, and
a modifier of plus or minus 5 if the character is at a major
bonus or major penalty for the check:

Technically,  circumstance  modifiers  could  apply  to  ei-
ther the check result of the difficulty class of a check, af-
fecting the character’s performance, or making the task
itself  easier  or  harder.  If  you  want  to  differentiate  be-
tween circumstance modifiers that affect performance
versus those that modify the difficulty of a task, feel free
to  do  so.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  applies  circumstance
modifiers directly to the check result because it is easier
to deal with them consistently, and the game effect is
the same: the chance of success changes.

Circumstance  modifiers  are  another  useful  Gamemas-
ter  tool  for  handling  a  lot  of  the  variables  that  come
up  during  game  play.  Specific  examples  are  discussed
throughout  the  rules  for  various  types  of  checks.  One
example includes the following:

CHAPTER 8: ACTION & ADVENTURE

243

Objects  (targets  lacking  a  Stamina  rank)  take  damage
similar to other targets. Dazed and staggered results have
no real effect on inanimate targets, since they do not take
actions. Constructs, capable of action, are dazed and stag-
gered  normally  (see  Constructs  in  the  Gadgets  &  Gear
chapter).

Inanimate objects are defenseless by definition and there-
fore subject to finishing attacks (see the Finishing Attack
maneuver): essentially, you can choose between making
your attack on the object as a routine check or, if you make
the  attack  check  normally,  gaining  an  automatic  critical
hit if your attack hits, for a +5 bonus to effect.

Attacking an object held or worn by another character is a
smash action (see the Smash maneuver).

If an attacker’s intention is to bend, break or destroy an ob-
ject, then two degrees of failure on the Toughness check
results  in  a  break  (such  as  a  hole  punched  through  the
object) while three or more degrees of failure means the
object is destroyed (shattered, smashed to pieces, etc.).

The  Toughness  ranks  of  some  common  materials  are
shown on the Material Toughness table. The listed ranks
are for about an inch (distance rank –7) thickness of the
material: apply a +1 per doubling of thickness or a –1 per
halving of it. So a foot of stone is Toughness 8. Equipment
has Toughness based on its material. Devices have a base
Toughness equal to the total points in the device divided
by 5 (rounded down, minimum of 1).

The Healing and Regeneration effects can speed this pro-
cess. Lasting or more serious injuries are handled as com-
plications (see Lasting Injuries).

Objects, having no Stamina, do not recover from damage
unless they have an effect like Regeneration. Instead, they
must be repaired. See the guidelines under the Technol-
ogy skill when repairing damaged objects.

RANGE

An attack has one of three ranges: close, ranged, and per-
ception.  A  close  attack  can  only  affect  a  target  you  can
physically  reach,  by  touch  or  wielding  a  melee  weapon,
for example. A ranged attack can affect a target at a dis-
tance, while a perception attack can hit a target you are
able  to  accurately  perceive  automatically  without  need
for an attack check.

A ranged attack has a short range up to its rank x 25 feet,
at which it has no penalties. At medium range (up to rank
x 50 feet), the attack check has a –2 circumstance modi-
fier. At long range (up to

In  some  settings,  the  Gamemaster  may  require  certain

powers  have  the “mutant”  descriptor  by  definition,  un-
less  the  player  comes  up  with  a  good  explanation  why
they should not. If all superhumans are psychic mutants,
then  all  powers  have  both  the  “psychic”  and  “mutant”
descriptors. The GM sets the rules as far as what descrip-
tors are required (or restricted) in the series. A character
who breaks this guideline—say the one alien in a setting
where all powers are otherwise mutant in origin—might
have a Benefit (unusual origin) or face certain complica-
tions, possibly both.

Effects with a duration of instant, concentration, or sustained
must be noticeable in some way. For example, a Blast effect
might  have  a  visible  beam  or  make  a  loud  noise  (ZAP!)  or
both. Some effects are quite obvious, such as Flight, Insub-
stantiality, Growth, or Shrinking. Effects with a continuous or
permanent duration are not noticeable by default.

If an instant, concentration, or sustained effect’s base dura-
tion is changed using modifiers, the effect remains notice-
able. A continuous or permanent effect made instant, con-
centration, or sustained also becomes noticeable. The Subtle
modifier (see page 196) can make noticeable powers difficult
or impossible to detect. Conversely, the Noticeable modifier
(see page 200) makes a normally subtle effect noticeable.

“Powers” in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS refer to all extraordinary
traits other than abilities, skills, and advantages. Whether a
character  with  powers  is “superhuman”  or  not  is  largely  a
matter of opinion and the descriptors used. For example,
there are lots of comic book characters with superhuman
traits  still  considered “normal”

Of course, fame has its drawbacks, which include persis-
tent fans, greater public scrutiny, and things like constant
offers  for  product  endorsements  and  such.  Famous  he-
roes are more likely to be targeted by supervillains look-
ing to make a name for themselves or novice heroes want-
ing to join an established team. While the heroes are most
trusted  by  the  authorities,  they’re  also  more  likely  to  be
called upon in times of need.

On  the  other  hand,  heroes  may  also  become  infamous
for their deeds, particularly if they’re known to be ruth-
less or mercenary. Infamy may dog heroes with bad pub-
licity, whether or not they’re actually guilty of anything.
After enough “Threat or Menace?” editorials, people start
to  wonder  if  the  hero  really  is  a  good  guy.  Reversals  in
reputation and sudden infamy make for good complica-
tions.

HONORS

In  addition  to  fame  and  fortune,  heroes  may  receive  the
gratitude  of  the  people  they  help. They  get  awards  from
civic groups and organizations like the police and fire de-
partments. The mayor gives them the key to the city or ar-
ranges for a parade in their honor (or both). The governor or
President honors them on national television. Monuments
may  be  erected  in  their  honor  and  charitable  institutions
founded or dedicated in their names. A hero team’s trophy
room can contain various plaques, medals, and other acco-
lades right alongside captured criminal memorabilia.

An  awards  ceremony  makes  a  good  ending  to  an  adven-
ture or, perhaps, the beginning of one. After all, what villain
can resist so public a target as a hated enemy receiving an
award? And so you’re off creating your next adventure!

Run a few MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games and, before you know, you will have an ongoing series, just like a comic series
created by you and your players! While you can simply create and run adventures, it is often helpful to have a map of
roughly where your series is going, much like the outline of an adventure’s various encounters. This section looks at
creating your own M&M series and, in effect, your very own universe! The primary elements of your series to consider
are its scale, setting, and style.

on adventures taking place in and around a single city, or

+/-2 for bonus/penalty
+/-5 for major bonus/penalty

Sometimes  characters  work  together  and  help  each  other
out. In this case, one character (usually the one with the high-
est bonus) is considered the leader of the effort and makes
the check normally, while each helper makes the same type
of check using the same trait(s) against DC 10. The helpers’ in-
dividual degrees of success (and failure!) are added together
to achieve the final outcome of the assistance.

Success grants the leader a +2 circumstance bonus. Three
or more total degrees of success grant a +5 circumstance
bonus.  One  degree  of  failure  provides  no  modifier,  but
two or more impose a –2 circumstance penalty!

The GM sets the limit on how many characters can help as
part of a team check. Regardless of the number of help-
ers, the leader’s bonus cannot be more than +5 (for three
or more total degrees of success) nor the penalty greater
than –2 (for two or more total degrees of failure).

Team Check = +2 circumstance bonus
for one total degree of success
+5 circumstance bonus for three or more total degrees of success
-2 circumstance penalty for two or more total degrees of failure

An  attack  check  determines  whether  or  not  you  hit  an
opponent  in  combat  with  an  attack.  It  is  a  d20  roll  plus
your bonus with that particular attack, usually based off
of  Fighting  or  Dexterity  and  appropriate  modifiers,  like
the Close and Ranged Combat skills. The difficulty is your
target’s  defense  class:  Parry  for  close  attacks,  Dodge  for
ranged attacks. Certain attacks may target other defenses.
If  you  equal  or  exceed  your  target’s  defense  class  result,
your attack hits. Otherwise, you miss.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus +
modifiers vs. defense class

A natural 20 on an attack check (where the die comes up
20) always hits and may be a critical hit (see Critical Hits in
the Action & Adventure chapter). A natural 1 on an attack
check (where the die comes up 1) always misses, regardless
of the check total. This differs from normal checks and re-
flects the variable and unpredictable nature of combat.

A  resistance  check  is  an  attempt  to  resist  different  ef-
fects, ranging from damage and injury to traps, poisons,
and various power effects. A resistance check is a d20 roll
+  the  appropriate  defense  (typically  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, or Will).

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Arrays—collections of Alternate Effects—are one of the more complex and important constructs in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS
and require some special care in terms of their creation and use. Players should take these things into account when
creating characters with arrays, and Gamemasters should consider them when approving such characters and dealing
with them in play.

The main reason for the Alternate Effect modifier is to allow a degree of flexibility in terms of a character’s power effects
within the cost restrictions laid down by having a finite number of power points. It’s based on the assumption that a wide
range of powers has a diminishing return in terms of value, since characters can only use so many effects at once. A power
with various “settings,” usable one at a time, is more valuable than a power with only one, but not as valuable as various
effects all usable at the same time.

However, Alternate Effect can be abused to try and squeeze the most “efficiency” out of a character’s power points, gain-
ing the most effects for the lowest cost. The guidelines for Alternate Effects are intended to help limit this somewhat, but
there is no way they can eliminate the possibility entirely and still provide all the benefits of flexibility they’re intended to
offer. Some Gamemaster oversight is therefore necessary when it comes to the creation and use of arrays.

Before giving a character Alternate Effects, it is wise to ask, “Is an array really needed for this concept?” Some concepts,
such as a variety of different attacks, clearly call for an array. Others, like a power with a few rarely used stunts, may not call
for an array. Such a power may be better served by acquiring such occasional stunts through extra effort and the spend-
ing of hero points rather than the creation of a permanent set of Alternate Effects. That is what the power stunts rules are
for, after all: so you do not have to fill up character sheets with minor Alternate Effects a hero will rarely ever use.

If you decide an array is appropriate, the first thing is to determine its overall theme and associated descriptors. Is it an ar-
ray of different attacks, like a “weapons array” of a battlesuit? Is it a collection of regular power stunts for a themed power
like earth control, or spells for magic? Is it a series of alternate forms for a metamorph? And so forth. Arrays should have
some unifying theme beyond “all the powers I want my hero to have,” and Gamemasters s

Choose  the  skill  ranks  you  want  your  character  to  have
and pay 1 power point per 2 total skill ranks. See the Skills

6. ADVANTAGES

Choose the advantages you want your character to have
and pay 1 power point per advantage or rank in a advan-
tage. See the Advantages chapter for details.

Create  your  hero’s  powers  by  choosing  their  desired  ef-
fects  and  paying  the  effects’  base  cost,  adjusted  for  any
modifiers, and multiplied by the number of ranks. See the
Powers chapter for details.
8. COMPLICATIONS

Choose at least two complications for your hero. You can
have more, if you want, and the more complications your
hero  faces,  the  greater  your  chances  for  earning  hero

points during the game. See the Complications section
of this chapter for details.
9. DETAILS

Go  through  the  limits  listed  under  Power  Level  in  this
chapter and make sure your hero’s traits all fit within them.
If not, adjust the traits accordingly until they do.

Go back through and add up the costs of your hero’s abili-
ties, defenses, skills, advantages, and powers. You should
end  up  with  a  figure  equal  to  the  starting  power  points
shown on the Starting Power Points table. If not, double-
check your math and either remove or add traits to your
character to reach the starting power point total.

Figure out things like your hero’s name, appearance, origin,
background, and motivation. If you can, consider creating a
sketch or detailed description of your hero’s costume.

10. GAMEMASTER APPROVAL

Show your new hero to the Gamemaster for approval. The
GM should check again to make sure your power points
are  spent  and  added  up  correctly,  your  hero  follows  the
power  level  guidelines  and  any  other  guidelines  set  for
the  series,  and  that  the  character  is  generally  complete
and  suited  to  the  overall  game.  Once  your  GM  has  ap-
proved, your new hero is ready for play!

You design a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero by spending pow-

On this and the following two pages, are a collection of twenty-one characters for use in all MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS games.
The characters range from the average man-on-the-street (Bystander) to highly trained soldiers and criminals. Many
of these characters fit into support roles, scientists, reporters, and street informants the heroes may go to in order to
get questions answered, while others are combatants. None of these characters will be a threat to PL10 characters, but
they’re often encountered in groups, which makes them more of a threat.

These characters are intended to be used when the GM needs a fairly common type of character that’s either around
to help or harm the character in some way depending on your series. They’re also meant to represent a wide range of
characters of that type. So, you can use the Police Officer to represent an actual police officer, but it could also be used
as the basis for a detective, highly-trained security professional, or bodyguard.

If you don’t see exactly the archetype you need, find something close and make a few changes. That should get you
close enough to keep the game moving quickly.

Scientists are specialists in their chosen field. This arche-
type  can  be  used  as  anything  from  an  archaeologist  to

feature and require characters to pay for it if their charac-
ters have such a costume. Otherwise characters have to
make do with ordinary clothing (which may be damaged
or destroyed when they use their powers).

Some devices are otherwise normal equipment with spe-
cial properties. Magical items, normal equipment imbued
with  magical  properties,  are  examples.  Magical  weap-
ons  may  have  greater  damage  bonuses  or  grant  attack
bonuses  while  magical  armor  imposes  no  penalties  and
provides  greater  protection.  Such  enchantments  move
archaic weapons and armor from the realm of mundane
equipment to devices. The same is true of equipment us-
ing super-alloys, bulletproof cloth, and other wonders of
super-science.

WEAPONS

Weapons are common devices, ranging from super-pow-
ered versions of ordinary weapons like swords, bows, or
guns  (see  Enhanced  Equipment)  to  more  exotic  weap-
ons  like  magic  wands  or  alien  power  rings.  A  weapon
device  usually  has  one  or  more  attack  effects  but  may
provide  virtually  any  effect  the  player  wants  to  include.
Weapons often have several different attacks as Alternate
Effects. One example is an array of magic rings, each with
its own effect, but only usable one at a time.

The full range of devices MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS characters
can create and use is limited solely by your imagination.
Essentially any item with a power is considered a device.
Players and GMs may well come up with devices beyond
those  described  here.  Use  the  guidelines  in  this  chapter
and in the Powers chapter to handle any new devices and
their capabilities.

INVENTING

Characters with the Inventor advantage can create inven-
tions,  temporary  devices. To  create  an  invention,  the  in-
ventor defines its effects and its cost in power points. This
cost is used for the necessary skill checks, and determines
the time required to create the invention. Inventions are
subject to the same power level limits as other effects in
the series.

First,  the  inventor  must  design  the  invention.  This  is  a
Technology skill check the GM should make in secret. The
DC is 10 + the invention’s total power point cost, including
all modifiers except Removable, which does not apply to
inventions, as they are temporary by nature.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

Heroes in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS cover a diverse range of power levels, from the first costumed adventurers of the Golden
Age, who relied solely on their skills and a few gimmicks (and modern vigilantes of the mean streets, who do much the
same), to the greatest protectors of the world, who take on cosmic threats on a regular basis. The following are some com-
mon power levels and starting power point values suitable for different M&M games:

LEVEL 8 - MASKED ADVENTURERS

This power level fits the “Mystery Men” era of the Golden Age of comic books, as well as for teams of mostly non-powered
adventurers: heroes who rely more on their skills and wits (and maybe a few gadgets) rather than amazing powers. The sug-
gested starting value of 120 power points creates well-rounded heroes at this level, particularly if the emphasis is on skills
and advantages—and maybe a power or two—rather than a lot of powers. Think Dr. Tomorrow and Foreshadow rather than
Captain Thunder and Daedalus. A higher starting power point total allows for more diverse capabilities within the same limits.

Heroes at this level often focus more on skill than sheer damage output, often having fighting skills in the 10–12 range,
but commensurately lower damage and effect ranks (using just their fists or small arms).

LEVEL 10 - SUPER HEROES

The suggested starting power level for MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS suits mature and experienced “adventurers” of the previous
level along with a wide range of younger or focused superhumans. This is the power level of the Sentinels, characters like
Bowman and Seven, and a great many of other heroes. It’s also good for powerful, but relatively inexperienced heroes like
Megastar when he first joined the Next-Gen.

Power level 10 heroes may have a balance of attack and effect, defense and resistance, or may go for being stronger on
one side than the other, having great combat skill, but comparatively limited damage, for example, or great Toughness,
but lowered defenses.

LEVEL 12 - BIG LEAGUES

Power level 12 is where you find many of the members of the current Freedom League: Daedalus, Lady Liberty, and the
Raven, to name a few. They are “senior” heroes, usually with considerable capabilities (and, often, experience). Those lacking
superhuman powers (such as the Raven) have amazing levels of skill and resources to draw upon while the superhuman
types are often among the most capable in

uses a standard, or “core,” game me-

an action with a chance of failure, do the following:

•

Roll a twenty-sided die (or d20).

Add any relevant modifiers (for game traits like abili-
ties, skills, powers, or circumstances) to the number
rolled.

Compare  the  total  to  a  number  called  a  difficulty
class (abbreviated DC).

If the result equals or exceeds the difficulty class (set by the
GM  based  on  the  circumstances),  the  effort  succeeds.  If
the result is lower than the difficulty class, it fails.

This simple mechanic is used for nearly everything in MU-
MASTERMINDS, with variations based on what modi-
fiers are made to the roll, what determines the difficulty
class, and the exact degree of success and failure. Remem-
ber...

d20 + modifiers vs. difficulty class

... and you understand how to play most of the game!

One of the players in a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game takes
the  role  of  Gamemaster  (abbreviated  GM).  The  Game-
master is responsible for running the game—a combina-
tion  of  writer,  director,  and  referee.  The  GM  creates  the
adventures for the heroes, portrays the villains and sup-
porting characters, describes the world to the players, and
decides the outcome of the heroes’ actions based on the
roll of the die and the guidelines given in the rules. It’s a
big  job,  but  also  a  rewarding  one,  since  the  Gamemas-
ter gets to develop the world and all the characters in it,
along with inventing fun and exciting stories.

If  you’re  going  to  be  the  Gamemaster,  you  should  read
through this whole book carefully. You should have a firm
grasp of the rules, since you’re expected to interpret them
for the players to help decide what happens in the game.
You’ll  also  help  the  players  develop  their  own  heroes,
making sure they fit into the world and have potential for
exciting stories in their own right.

Example:  Makeshift  needs  to  whip  up  a  mind-
shielding  device  to  confront  Gepetto,  who  has
seized control of his teammates. Immunity to Mind
Control (a common Affliction effect) cost 5 power
points, so the Technology check is DC 15 (10 + 5)
and takes 5 hours. Makeshift’s skill bonus is +15, so
he succeeds automatically. The construction check
is  also  DC  15  (10  +  the  device’s  cost).  It  takes  20
hours. Makeshift again succeeds automatically on
the  check.  However,  that’s  25  hours  total  to  build
the  mind-shield,  and  Gepetto  plans  to  send  his
new “puppets” into action in just a few hours. Even
taking a –15 check penalty to cut the time to one-
eighth only takes it down to just over three hours.
Makeshift needs that device right now, so he’s go-
ing to need to speed things up....

you speed up the process any further by taking a check
penalty.  You  can  use  a  jury-rigged  invention  again  by
spending another hero point.

Example:  Needing  to  get  the  mind  shield  device
ready  right  away,  Makeshift’s  player  decides  to
spend a hero point to jury-rig it. He skips the design
step  altogether  and  reduces  construction  time  to
5 rounds (just under a minute). The DC of the con-
struction check increases to 20, but still well within
Makeshift’s skill; the player only needs to roll a 5 or
better. He rolls a 25 result on the check and, a min-
ute later, Makeshift has a makeshift mind-shield he
hopes will protect him from Gepetto’s power long
enough to try and free his teammates from the vil-
lain’s influence.

DEVICES

MISHAPS

An inventor can choose to spend a hero point to jury-rig a
device; ideal for when a particular device is needed right
now.  When  jury-rigging  a  device,  skip  the  design  check
and  reduce  the  time  of  the  construction  check  to  one
round  per  power  point  of  the  device’s  cost,  but  increase
the DC of the check by +5. The inventor makes the check
and, if successful, has use of the device for one scene be-
fore it burns out, falls apart, blows up, or otherwise fails.
You can’t jury-rig an invention as a routine check, nor can

It’s that simple. Note that, practically speaking, a major cir-
cumstance modifier effectively shifts a check up or down
a  degree  of  difficulty,  as  shown  on  the  Difficulty  Class
Examples  table.  Likewise,  a  major  modifier  effectively
changes the degree of a graded check by one (see Grad-
ed Checks in Chapter 1).

Routine checks reflect that some tasks and situations are
so  trivial  it  is  not  worth  having  a  player  roll  a  check.  It
would be illogical for the character to have a real chance
of failing at the task, since failure should be rare enough
to constitute a complication in that situation. Examples in-
clude things like a competent driver handling a car under
ordinary conditions or a trained professional performing
the routine tasks of a job.

Routine checks save time, because you do not need to ask
players  for  a  check  for  every  single  thing  their  characters
do, but they also provide valuable guidelines for when you
should ask the players for a check while running the game.
They  set  a  threshold  for  the  Difficulty  of  certain  actions.
When coming up with Difficulty Classes for your adventure,
keep the routine check rule in mind. If the DC is low enough
that anyone can succeed as a routine check, then it may be
too low, or the action may not be worth assigning a check.

Take Perception, for example. If you decide it is a DC 10
Perception  check  to  pick  up  on  some  clue  or  bit  of  in-
formation in the adventure, that Difficulty is low enough
that anyone with an unimpaired (0 or higher) Awareness
can succeed at the task as a routine check. Assuming the
information is also important to the plot, you might be
better off to simply tell the players their characters no-
tice  it  without  calling  for  a  check.  If  there  needs  to  be
a  chance  of  failure,  then  set  a  higher  Difficulty  for  the
check. Of course, If the situation is stressful—such as the
midst of combat—then a routine check is not an option,
and  a  lower  DC  can  provide  heroes  with  a  reasonably
high chance of success with just a small chance of failure
for dramatic purposes.

“TELL ME HOW IT HAPPENS...”

Sometimes  it’s  a  good  idea  to  make  checks  secretly,  so
the players don’t necessarily know the result. This is usu-
ally  the  case  for  any  sort  of  check  where  the  characters
don’t  immediately  know  whether  they’ve  succeeded  or
failed. For example, Perce

less,  disabled,  exhausted,  immobile,  prone,  or  stunned
(choose  one).  Potential  descriptors  include  agonizing
pain, confusion, ecstasy, momentary emotional or men-
tal influence, paralysis, seizure, terror, or vomiting.

Failure  (three  degrees):  The  target  is  asleep,  con-
trolled,  incapacitated,  paralyzed,  transformed  or  un-
aware (choose one).

The target of an Affliction makes a resistance check at the
end of each of his turns to remove first and second degree
conditions. Third  degree  conditions  require  a  minute  of
recovery time or outside aid, such as the Treatment skill or
Healing effect (DC 10 + rank).

The exact nature and descriptors of the Affliction are up
to you, chosen when you acquire the effect, with the GM’s
approval;  some  examples  are  provided,  but  feel  free  to
make up your own.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Powers  based  off  the Variable  effect  are  obviously  very  flexible,  capable  of  duplicating  a  wide  range  of  other  effects.
Responsibility for controlling Variable effects in the game is placed largely in the hands of both the Gamemaster and
responsible players. To do otherwise would require weighing the effect down with numerous game-system limitations
that would keep it from doing what it is supposed to do: create a wide range of effects.

Keep in mind a Variable effect is not supposed to be “any effect I want.” That kind of unlimited power doesn’t belong in the
hands of player characters, and is better reserved as a plot device for NPCs. A Variable effect can be “any effect within a
given set of parameters,” but it’s up to you and the GM to define those parameters. The limits of power flexibility in MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS are deliberately set by Variable effects, the use of extra effort, and hero points.

Many  comic  book  heroes  who  appear  to  have  the  power  to “do  anything”  are  actually  using  one  of  these  options  in
terms.  For  example,  a  super-wizard  can  do  practically  anything  with  magic.  However,  generally
speaking, these characters have certain abilities they use all the time (powers they have acquired with power points) and
“stunts” they only do from time to time, essentially power stunts performed with extra effort (and possibly hero points).
This is why the Magic power given later in this chapter, for example, is not a Variable effect: most powers in the game
have the potential to do “stunts” via extra effort, so the “variability” of Magic seen in the comics is already built-in to the
system, with some costs to control it, without having to give players carte blanche to duplicate any effect in the game at
will (which is just likely to slow things down and cause game balance issues).

Variable effects are better reserved for things where it is difficult to cost-out and define everything about a given power in
advance. For example, the ability to shapechange into any animal could be an application of the Morph effect with a long
list of Metamorph options, but listing out every single possible animal form, one at a time, would be tedious to say the
least, especially when a good number of those forms would be superfluous. A Variable effect, with the descriptor “animal
forms” is easier to manage. The player can pre-build certain commonly used animal forms for use during play, but also ha

Insight  check.  Senses  with  the  Counters  Illusion  effect
(see Senses) automatically detect illusions. If any viewer
successfully uncovers an illusion and communicates this
fact to others, they gain another Insight check with a +5
circumstance bonus. Circumstances may grant additional
modifiers to the Insight check to uncover an illusion, de-
pending on how convincing it is.

Maintaining an active illusion (such as a fighting creature)
requires a standard action each round, but maintaining a
static illusion (one that doesn’t move or interact) is only a
free action.

EXTRAS

Illusion is a broad-ranging effect, usable for a number of
different things. A few common considerations for Illu-
sion include the following.

Independent: Your active illusions only require a free action
to maintain, rather than a standard action. +1 cost per rank.

Selective:  You  choose  who  perceives  your  Illusion  and
who doesn’t. +1 cost per rank.

For illusions so realistic they are capable of inflicting dam-
age, add a Linked Perception Range Damage effect. At the
GM’s discretion, this effect can even be made into a Linked
Array  with  a  variety  of  alternate  attack  effects,  allowing
your illusionist to inflict conditions other than damage on
targets. Keep in mind the attack effects all need to be per-
ception range to match the range of Illusion.

Illusion  can  alter  a  subject’s  appearance,  providing  an
essentially impenetrable disguise—at least until some-
one  makes  a  successful  check  to  see  through  the  illu-
sion.  However,  for  just  the  ability  to  alter  appearance,
use the Morph effect, which is generally more effective
than Illusion Limited to Appearance.

The  default  Illusion  effect  is  perceptible  to  anyone  or
anything  (including  machines)  as  if  it  were  real.  Some
illusions exist solely in the mind, like projected psychic
hallucinations. This type of Illusion has the Resistible by
Will flaw and the Selective extra, since the illusionist can
choose whether or not to project the illusion into a par-
ticular subject’s mind, and therefore decides who can or
cannot perceive the illusion. This is a net +0 modifier, for
the same base cost.
MY ALLY, MY ENEMY

A common Illusion trick is to switch the appearances of
an  enemy  and  an  ally,  causing  a  foe’s  teammate  to  at-
tack  that  enemy  by  mistake. You  can  generally  handle
this with an opposed check of Illusion and Insight; if you

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

265

More  than  a  few  comic  books  speculate  about  the  fu-
ture. There are science fiction comics aplenty, along with
super-hero stories set at different points in Earth’s future.

A near future setting may be quite similar to the modern-
day, with the addition of some new technology and the
new problems that come with it. For example there may
be flying cars, cybernetic and genetic modifications, and
advances  in  computer  technology  along  with  increases
in crime and urban decay. Heroes can stalk the streets of
dark, towering cities trying to protect the innocent where
a corrupt legal system has failed.

Some  future  comic  stories  are  set  following  a  terrible
catastrophe  that  has  all  but  destroyed  civilization.  In  a
setting  like  this  the  heroes  may  be  the  last  survivors  of
ordinary  humanity,  or  super-powered  mutants,  trained
super-soldiers (perhaps intended as weapons in the Last
War), or even cyborgs or aliens. Their adventures tend to
revolve around protecting pockets of civilization from ma-
rauding  mutants  and  keeping  ambitious  warlords  from
conquering the world or destroying innocent people.

Far future settings feature faster-than-light space travel, al-
lowing heroes to visit (or come from) any of dozens or even
hundreds  of  different  worlds.  A  team  made  up  of  heroes
from  these  different  worlds  could  band  together  to  pro-
tect the interstellar government from hostile alien invaders
while also dealing with disasters, space pirates, and crimi-
nal  cartels.  Or  a  group  can  explore  the  unknown  reaches
of space on board a starship, encountering would-be con-
querors, despots, raiders, and other villains along the way.

STYLE

Just as comics themselves span the stylistic gamut from
lighthearted  adventure  to  intricately  plotted,  grim  mo-
rality  plays,  so  can  a  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  series  vary  in
style. Once a style of play is established, it’s up to the GM
to  maintain  it.  That  means  creating  adventures  and  en-
counters suited to that style and encouraging the players
to get into the style’s mindset and run their characters ac-
cordingly. Styles run along a spectrum from light to dark:

LIGHT

The light style is simple and straightforward. The heroes
are the good guys and the villains are usually bad through
and  through  (with  a  few  misunderstood  souls  in  need
of help). Problem solving is a matter of eith

The  bonus  from  a  Close  Combat  skill  applies  only  to  at-
tack checks with the particular attack, not to defenses. For
a broader bonus to attack checks that is less than simply
raising  Fighting  rank,  see  the  Close  Attack  advantage  in
the Advantages chapter.

DECEPTION

Presence • Interaction

Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you
want them to believe. It covers things like acting, bluffing,
fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.

Deception takes as long as it takes to spin-out your story.
Uses of Deception in action rounds are generally standard
actions, although you can attempt to deceive as a move
action by taking a –5 penalty to your check.

BLUFFING

Make  a  Deception  check  to  tell  a  believable  lie  or  get
someone do go along with you.

A  bluff  is  usually  opposed  by  the  target’s  Deception  or
Insight  check.  Favorable  and  unfavorable  circumstances
weigh  heavily  on  the  outcome.  Two  circumstances  can
work against you: the deception is hard to believe, or what
you  ask  goes  against  the  target’s  self-interest,  nature,  or
personality.

If it’s important, you can distinguish between a deception
that  fails  because  the  target  doesn’t  believe  it  and  one
that fails because it asks too much. For instance, if the tar-
get gets a +10 bonus to resistance because the deception
demands serious risk, and the resistance check succeeds
by 10 or less, then the target doesn’t so much see through
the deception as prove reluctant to go along with it. If the
target’s Insight check succeeds by 11 or more, he has seen
through  the  deception,  and  would  have  refused  even  if
it had not placed unusual demands on him (that is, even
without the +10 modifier).

MODIFIER

The target wants
to believe you.

The deception is believable
and doesn’t affect the target
much either way.

The deception is a little hard
to believe or puts the target at
some kind of risk.

The deception is difficult
to believe or entails
a serious risk.

The deception is way
out there, almost too
incredible to consider.

1-4 RANKS

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  broken  down  into
sense types, used as descriptors for sensory effects. Here
are  the  traits  of  normal  human  senses,  for  use  when
modifying them with the options from Senses:

VISUAL

Normal  vision  is  ranged  (with  a  –1/10  feet  modifier),
acute (able to distinguish fine details) and accurate (able
to pinpoint the locations of things).
AUDITORY

Normal hearing is ranged  (with  a –1/10  feet modifier),
acute  (able  to  pick  up  details  like  differences  in  tone),
and radius (able to pick up on sounds coming from any
direction). Normal hearing is not accurate.

OLFACTORY

Normal  human  olfactory  senses,  which  lump  together
smell  and  taste  for  descriptor  purposes,  are  fairly  lim-
ited. Ordinary human olfactory senses are neither acute
nor accurate. The sense of smell is a radius sense, how-
ever, able to pick up on scents coming from any direc-
tion. Its “range” is quite limited, however, effectively only
close, except for especially strong scents.

TACTILE

The normal sense of touch is, by definition, close range.
It is accurate (in that you know the location of anything
you  can  touch)  and  radius  (in  that  you  can  feel  things
from any surface of your body).

MENTAL

In MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS terms, the “sixth sense” or men-
tal  sense  type  is  fairly  crude  in  normal  humans,  lim-
ited essentially to interactions with the Insight skill and
awareness of mental effects used directly on you. Thus it
is close range and has none of the Sense qualities.

You can see in the infrared portion of the spectrum, allow-
ing you to see heat patterns. Darkness does not provide
concealment  for  objects  differing  in  temperature  from
their  surroundings.  If  you  have  the Track  effect,  you  can
track warm creatures by the faint heat trails they leave be-
hind. The Gamemaster is the final judge on how long the
trail remains visible.

You can view extremely small things. You can make Per-

scale  opens  up  larger  potential  threats. You  can  destroy
entire worlds at these levels to demonstrate what the he-
roes are up against, whereas such a threat would wipe out
an entire smaller scale setting.

SETTING

The setting is where and when the series takes place. Is it
the modern-day, medieval times, the wild west, or the far
future solar system? Each of the following settings has its
positives  and  negatives,  and  each  is  suited  to  particular
types of games.

MODERN

Most of the time, a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS series is set in a
version of our modern world. This approach is the easiest
one by far, since there isn’t as much you have to make up.
You don’t have to explain to your players where New York
City is, for example.

If  your  M&M  game  is  set  in  the  modern-day  world,  you
may want to choose a particular city or area as the heroes’
home base. Even a truly global team needs some place to
call home, such as an orbiting satellite or the top floors of
a skyscraper.

A fun option can be to use your home city (or one near-
by) as the setting for your series. It offers a familiar locale
along  with  the  fun  of  having  superheroes  and  villains
duke it out around your local landmarks!

Many comics and series feature heroes that live in fictional
cities, places that don’t exist in the real world but are often
remarkably similar to various real world cities. You can do
something similar in your own series, perhaps based on
the place where you live.

Of course, your modern setting is not necessarily the mod-
ern universe: with parallel Earths, yours could be like the
real world, but with whatever changes you want.

The Golden Age of comics began in the 1930s and MU-
can easily be set any time in the past
seventy-five years. Players can take the roles of “mystery
men”  and  the  first  superheroes,  fighting  against  gang-
sters and the forces of the Axis in World War II. They can
be  government  agents  or  patriotic  heroes  during  the
Cold  War  with  Russia,  or  counter-culture  rebels  during
the 1960s.

But  nothing  says  you  can’t  go  farther  back  in  history  if
you  want.  Comic  books  have  told  stories  about  heroes
from nearly every time period. There’s World War I and the
American Revolutionary War. The Wild West offers cowboy
heroes,  Native  American  shaman,  and  steam-tech  weird
science. Medieval heroes could face evil wizards, goblins,
and monsters. You c

CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Descriptors help to bring a collection of effects and modifiers to life, differentiating them from similar (or even identical)
configurations and making them into distinct powers. Although descriptors don’t always have significant game effects
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, they’re perhaps the most important element in providing color and character to the powers
of heroes and villains.

Descriptors do have some affect on game play. In particular, descriptors often govern how certain effects interact
with each other, serving as convenient shorthand to help define an effect’s parameters. For example, Immunity and
Nullify work against effects with specific descriptors; if they were limited solely to things like effect type, it would
leave out a tremendous range of options, like “Immunity to Fire” or “Nullify Mutant Powers,” which are important to
the source material.

Descriptors  come  in  many  different  forms.  The  break-
down in this section is inexact, and deliberately so; some
descriptors fall into more than one category, while others
might not fall into any of these categories, being unique
to  that  particular  character  or  power.  Still,  the  following
are the major types of descriptors suited to MUTANTS & MAS-
powers, and things to consider when creating or
choosing powers for a character.
ORIGIN

A descriptor may relate to the origin of a power, where it
comes  from  or  what  granted  it  to  the  character.  For  ex-
ample, did he gain Speed in a scientific accident or from
years of focused meditation at a secret temple to the God
of Speed? A power’s origin may determine how it interacts
with  other  powers.  Some  powers  with  the  same  origin
might be better suited to counter each other, for example,
or  to  work  in  conjunction,  combining  their  benefits.  Ex-
amples of origin descriptors include:

•

•

•

Accidental powers are the result of random chance
or  accident:  being  struck  by  lightning,  doused  in
chemicals, exposed to exotic radiation, and so forth.
The circumstances of an accidental origin may or may
not  be  something  others  can  duplicate  (although
some are sure to try).

Bestowed powers are granted by an outside agency
of some sort, such as a deity, a technology, an alien
race,  or  another  superhuman. The  process  that  be-
stows  the  powers  can  be  transitory  or  effectively
permanent, barring some sort of plot device or GM-
created setback.

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

CHAPTER 3: ABILITIES

The  exception  is  Toughness,  which  can  only  be  increased
above your base Stamina rank using advantages and pow-
ers, not by direct spending of power points. This reflects that
greater-than-normal Toughness is virtually always some sort
of special ability. See the Advantages and Powers chapters
for various options for improving Toughness, notably the De-
fensive Roll advantage and the Protection effect.

Dodge and Parry defenses require a measure of action to
be fully effective. Limits on your mobility, focus, and reac-
tion time adversely affect them. If you are vulnerable, your
Dodge  and  Parry  defense  ranks  are  halved  (divide  their
normal values by 2 and round up), and if you are defense-
less, they are both reduced to 0!

One  use  of  defenses  is  determining  a  defense  class,  or
the  difficulty  class  to  affect  a  target  with  a  particular  at-
tack. This  is  the  appropriate  defense,  plus  10,  just  like  a
routine  check  (indeed,  it  is  essentially  a  measure  of  the
character’s “routine” defense). So hitting a character with
a ranged attack goes against Dodge defense, giving the
attack a DC of (Dodge + 10). Similarly, affecting someone
with a mental power goes against Will defense, with a DC
of (Will + 10), and so forth. This is referred to as “targeting”
a defense, such as “targets Dodge” or “targets Will”.

The main defense class traits are Dodge, Parry, and Will.

Defenses  are  also  used  to  measure  the  ability  to  over-
come certain effects, involving a resistance check of the
defense plus a die roll against a difficulty class determined
by the effect or hazard. So you might make a Fortitude re-
sistance check for your hero to overcome a toxin, for ex-
ample, or a Dodge resistance check to avoid a trap just as
it is triggered, and so on. This is referred to as “resisting,”
such as “resisted by Fortitude” or “resisted by Dodge”.

The  main  resistance  check  traits  are  Dodge,  Fortitude,
Toughness, and Will.

When  things  start  happening  quickly,  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
characters use their initiative bonuses to determine
who goes first. Each character involved in a conflict makes
a check of d20 + initiative modifier, which is:

Initiative Modifier = Agility + Advantages
(Improved Initiative) + Power Modifiers

Characters then act in initiative order, from highest to low-
est. For details see the Action & Adventure chapter.

can quickly become a problem (especially when the he-
roes feel honor-bound to see their “teammate” answer for
his crimes). So it’s best to be sure everyone is on the same
page to avoid unnecessary disagreements.

Another common element in the comics is the loner char-
acter: dressed in black, often trained in stealth, and prefer-
ring to work alone. That’s all well and good in a solo story,

but difficult to include in a team of superheroes. You can
get  away  with  a  loner  who  is  a  reluctant  team  member
in-character with players who understand and play along
with the bit. Far worse is a team of loners, none of whom
get  along! You  can  accommodate  some  loner  characters
by giving them opportunities to show off their skills and
requiring a minimum level of cooperation and willingness
to  work  within  the  team.  You’re  better  off  discouraging
entire  groups  of  loners  right  from  the  beginning,  since
odds are they won’t work together for very long.

Creating a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game is a fairly simple process. First, define the threat around which the adventure
revolves. Then sketch out the overall plot, and describe the encounters the heroes are likely to have during the adven-
ture. You’ll also want to make sure you have statistics and character sheets for important supporting characters and vil-
lains. Present the players with the start of the adventure and you’re off and running. Will things go exactly the way you
planned? Probably not, but that’s part of the fun and challenge of being a Gamemaster!

HEROES...

There are a number of things to consider when you begin
planning  an  adventure,  including  the  plot  threads  from
previous adventures, complications, and the themes and
events of past adventures.

If the adventure is not the first in your series, then the first
thing to do is look over your last few adventures. Are there
any  dangling  plot  threads  left  over  from  those  stories,
ones the players might be interested in following?

If this is your first adventure, you need to consider a few
things,  including  how  to  get  the  heroes  together  as  a
team. They  may  already  be  a  team  when  the  adventure
begins—especially  if  your  players  are  using  established
heroes—or  circumstances  in  the  adventure  might  bring
them together.

The  key  things  for  a  first  adventure  are  to  introduce  the
players  to  the  setting  and  the  major  supportin

Insulating Fur: You have a layer of fur that protects
you from intense heat and cold, giving you immunity
to those environments.

Internal Compartment: You can carry a portion of
your carrying capacity inside your body! You have a
pouch  or  compartment  of  some  sort,  able  to  hold
objects with a size rank no greater than 3 less than
your own (size -5 for a normal size rank -2 human).

Iron  Stomach: You  can  eat  anything  that’s  not  toxic
without ill effects, no matter how unpleasant it may be:
spoiled or particularly gross or spicy food, for example.

•  Mimicry: You can imitate almost any sound you’ve
heard, giving you a +10 bonus to Deception checks
to convince others your mimicked sounds are real.

The  Feature  effect  is  intended  to  round  out  various
minor traits and abilities characters might have, but it
is entirely optional and not meant to burden MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS character design with needless amounts
of detail. It’s for traits with an actual game effect, not
merely  descriptors  or  background  color  (neither  of
which should cost any points). Ultimately, the Game-
master  decides  what  traits  merit  a  rank  (or  more)  of
Feature and what Features are permitted for any given
game or setting, using the examples given here.

If  a  “feature”  is  something  likely  to  come  up  only
occasionally, or even just once, then you are better
off  allowing  it  as  an  aspect  of  the  inspiration  and
power  stunt  rules  (see  the  Characteristics  chap-
ter), charging the player a hero point for the feature
when it comes into play. The player can then choose
whether  or  not  to  use  earned  power  points  to  ac-
quire the Feature as a regular part of the character’s
traits later on.

gust of wind at the right dramatic moment, or ideal
spotlighting, or personal theme music. The GM may
give  you  a  +2  bonus  for  favorable  circumstances

ing  Damage  resisted  by  Fortitude.  At  the  GM’s  discre-
tion,  radiation  exposure  can  lead  to  other  effects,  such
as damage to a hero’s power ranks (causing a temporary
decrease in powers).
VACUUM

The primary hazards of the vacuum of space are lack of air
and exposure to unfiltered ionizing radiation.

On  the  third  round  of  exposure  to  vacuum,  a  character
must  succeed  on  a  Fortitude  check  (DC  20)  each  round
or suffer from aeroembolism (“the bends”). A failed check
means excruciating pain as small air bubbles form in the
creature’s  bloodstream;  the  creature  is  stunned  and  re-
mains so until returned to normal atmospheric pressure.
Two or more degrees of failure impose the incapacitated
condition.

The real danger of vacuum comes from suffocation, though
holding one’s breath in vacuum damages the lungs. A char-
acter who attempts to hold his breath must make a Forti-
tude check (DC 15) every round; the DC increases by 1 each
round, and on a successful check the character loses a rank
of Stamina (from the pressure on the linings of his lungs). If
the check fails, or when the character simply stops holding
his breath, he begins to suffocate: the next round, he be-
comes incapacitated . The following round, he’s dying and
cannot stabilize until returned to a normal atmosphere.

Unfiltered  radiation  bombards  any  character  trapped  in
the vacuum of space without protective gear, see Radia-
tion, previously.

Heroes able to ignore the effects of deep space must have
Immunity to suffocation, vacuum, and radiation, at a mini-
mum. See the Immunity effect in the Powers chapter for
details.

CONFLICTS

A conflict is when two or more characters go up against each other, typically in a fight of some sort. Conflict between
heroes and villains is a prime part of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS and a big element of the fun, just like the colorful and spec-
tacular fights in the superhero comic books.

ATTACKS

An attack check represents an attempt to hit a target with
an attack. When you make an attack check, roll the die and
add your bonus with that attack. If your result equals or
exceeds  the  target’s  defense,  your  attack  hits  and  may
have some effect.

Attack Check = d20 + attack bonus vs.
defense class

When you make an attack check and get a natural 20 (the
d20 actually shows 20), you automatically hit, regardless
of  your  target’s  defense,  and  you  score  a  threat. The  hit

CHAPTER 4: SKILLS

113

You can get a general idea of just how good a particu-
lar character’s skill bonus is using the general difficulty
class  guidelines  given  in  The  Basics  along  with  the
rules  for  routine  checks  (see  Routine  Checks  in  that
chapter).

For  example,  a  +5  total  skill  modifier  means  the  char-
acter can routinely achieve a result of 15 (a tough task).
Safe to say the character is a pro, able to routinely han-
dle tasks that would prove too much for someone less
skilled.  A  character  with  a  +10  skill  modifier  achieve  a
DC 20 (challenging task) on a routine basis, a real level of
expertise, while a +15 modifier can routinely complete
DC  25  (formidable)  tasks.  At  the  high  end,  a  +30  skill
modifier  can  routinely  accomplishing  the  nigh  impos-
sible (DC 40 tasks)!

Certain skills, called interaction skills, are aimed at deal-
ing  with  others  through  social  interaction.  Interaction
skills allow you to influence the attitudes of others and get
them to cooperate with you in one way or another. Since
interaction skills are intended for dealing with others so-
cially, they have certain requirements.

First,  you  must  be  able  to  interact  with  the  subject(s)  of
the  skill. They  must  be  aware  of  you  and  able  to  under-
stand you. If they can’t hear or understand you for some
reason, you have a –5 circumstance penalty to your skill
check (see Circumstance Modifiers in The Basics).

Interaction  skills  work  best  on  intelligent  subjects,  ones
with  an  Intellect  rank  of  –4  or  better. You  can  use  them
on creatures with Int –5, but again with a –5 circumstance
penalty;  they’re  just  too  dumb  to  get  the  subtleties  of
your  point. You  can’t  use  interaction  skills  at  all  on  sub-
jects lacking one or more mental abilities. (Try convincing
a  rock  to  be  your  friend—or  afraid  of  you—sometime.)

If you don’t find a particular skill on the list, like climbing,
bluffing, or search, remember that each skill in MUTANTS &
covers a lot of ground. So, you’ll find climbing
isn’t its own skill, but is listed as part of Athletics, while
bluffing and search are under Deception and Investiga-
tion, respectively. When in doubt, read through the skill
you think is most similar to what you’re looking for.

The  Immunity  effect  (see  the  Powers  chapter)  can  also
render characters immune to interaction skills.

GOALS

How would you describe your hero’s personality? While
heroes  tend  to  share  a  desire  to  use  their  powers  for
good and uphold the law, they also show a diverse range
of attitudes. One hero may be dedicated to the ideals of
truth,  justice,  and  equality  while  another  is  a  vigilante
willing to break the law in order to ensure justice is done.
Some heroes are forthright and cheerful while others are
grim and unrelenting. Consider your hero’s attitudes and
personality traits. Don’t overlook the effect of Motivation
on  your  hero’s  personality  and  vice  versa  (see  Motiva-
tion, previously).

Finally, what are your hero’s goals? All heroes want things
like peace and justice to one degree or another, but what
other  things  does  your  hero  want?  One  hero  may  want
to  find  his  long-lost  family  while  another  may  want  to
avenge a terrible wrong done to her in the past. A mon-
strous or alien hero may seek acceptance and a new home
on Earth, while a teen hero may want to live up to the leg-
acy of a mentor or predecessor. Giving your hero a goal
beyond simply “doing good” can help give the character
more  depth  and  provide  opportunities  for  roleplaying
and complications during the game. Don’t overlook it.

The Gamemaster awards heroes power points at the end of each MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS story. This represents the experi-
ence and confidence the heroes have gained, along with other factors contributing to an improvement in their abilities,
skills, and powers.

Generally, heroes each receive 1 power point for a successfully completed adventure that lasts for one game session.
If the heroes overcame especially powerful foes or difficult challenges, the GM can increase the power point award to
2 points. For adventures lasting more than one game session, the heroes should get 1 power point per session, plus a
possible power point at the end if they did particularly well.

Gamemasters may vary the rate of advancement by awarding more power points per adventure, allowing heroes to
increase in power faster, which may suit certain styles of play. The Gamemaster also may choose not to award a power
point for an adventure in which the heroes did especially poorly, such as failing to defeat a villain’s major scheme or al-
lowing many innocent people to suffer harm they could have prevented.

Players can spend their heroes’ awarded power points in-betwee

a hero has Agility 6 and is trained in Acrobatics (with a rank
of 7) then the character’s bonus for checks involving feats
of agility covered by Acrobatics is 13 (6 plus 7). Obviously,
training in a skill makes characters more effective at checks
involving that skill, often much more.

For details on what skills are available and what they do,
see the Skills chapter.

Halfway between skills and powers, advantages are minor
benefits characters have, allowing them to do things oth-
ers cannot. They range from special combat maneuvers to
things like financial resources, contacts, and so forth.

Many advantages have no rank, or rather just one rank; a
character either has the advantage (and the benefits that
it grants) or does not. Other advantages may have multiple
ranks, like abilities and skills, measuring their effectiveness.

For details on the various advantages and what they pro-
vide, see the Advantages chapter.

When  using  the  Measurements  Table,  there  are  a  few
important things to keep in mind:

•

•

•

Each rank represents a range of measures. Time
rank  4  is  actually  all  measures  between  1  and  2
minutes, and time rank 16 is everything between 2
and 4 days! So if you’re looking for a measurement
that’s not on the table, pick the next highest one
that is; so 12 hours is a time rank of 13 (more than
8 hours, but less than 16), and 6 miles is a distance
rank of 11 (more than 4 miles, but less than 8).

Like abilities, measures can have negative ranks.
In the time rank example, the time it takes a Speed
14 hero to cover 30 miles is rank –1, or 3 seconds.
You can extend the negative side the Measurement
Table just like you can the positive side, with each
lower  rank  halving  the  previous  measurement.  So
rank –6 is half a pound, 1/16th of a second, and 3
inches, for example.

Don’t directly add ranks.  Putting  rank  4  distance
together with rank 6 distance is not rank 10 distance!
Rank 4 is a distance measurement of 500 feet. Rank 6
is 600 yards (1,800 feet). Adding the measurements,
you get about 2,300 feet. If you directly added the
ranks, you’d get rank 10 distance, or 4 miles! If you
have different ranks, it is best to either handle them
separately  or  convert  them  to  measurements,  add
the measurements together, and convert them back
to a rank. In the previous example, 2,300 feet is rank
7 distance (around half a mile).

Time Rank = Distance Rank - Speed Rank

Reversing  the  previous  formula,  we  can  also  figure  out
how long it takes someone at a particular speed to cov-
er  a  given  distance,  by  subtracting  the  speed  rank  from
the distance rank to get a time rank. So a normal human
(speed  0)  walking  30  miles  (distance  13)  takes  about  16
hours. A hero with Speed 14 covers the same distance in
(13 – 14 = –1) just 3 seconds!

Throwing Distance Rank =
Strength Rank - Mass Rank

As  another  example,  the  distance  rank  a  hero  can  throw
something equals the hero’s Strength rank minus the mass
rank of the object. So a hero with Strength 10 (able to lift 25
tons), picks up a 10-ton truck (mass rank 9). Since 10-9=1,
the hero can then toss the truck rank 1 distance (60 feet)!

GAME PLAY

A session of the MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game resembles an issue of a comic book or an episode of an animated series.
The Gamemaster and the players get together and tell a story through the process of playing the game. The length of
the game session can vary, from just a couple hours to several hours or more. Some adventures may be completed in a
single session while others may take multiple sessions, just as some comic book stories are told in one issue while others
span multiple issues, forming a story arc or mini-series. The episodic nature of the game allows you to choose when to
stop playing and allows you to start up again at any time you and your friends want.

Also like a comic book, a M&M game consists of a series of interrelated scenes. Some scenes are fairly straightforward,
with the heroes interacting with each other and the supporting cast. In these cases the GM generally just asks the play-
ers to describe what their heroes are doing and in turn describes how the other characters react and what they do. There
may be some improvisational acting as everyone plays out the roles of their characters. When the action starts hap-
pening, such as when the heroes are staving off a disaster or fighting villains, time becomes more crucial and is broken
down into action rounds, and the players generally have to make die rolls to see how their heroes do.

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

HOOD: COMPLICATIONS AND UP-FRONT REWARDS

Some roleplaying game systems include complications, disadvantages, or similar problematic character traits which offer
“bonus points” for creating the character; essentially, you get more points for your character’s good traits when you take
on some bad ones.

The problem with such “up-front” rewards for giving a character flaws is that the player gets all of the reward (the bo-
nus design points) immediately, but the disadvantage only occasionally limits or affects the character, sometimes even
randomly. Since there is only so much “screen time” in a game session, there is virtually no way for the GM to spotlight
every one of every character’s disadvantages, so some end up being worth “more” in the sense of reward in exchange for
drawbacks. Plus, after they have “paid out” their initial benefit, front-loaded negative traits are nothing but a burden to the
character from that point forward, leading players to try and avoid or mitigate them as much as possible.

Complications address this issue by having a “pay-as-you-go” approach: if the GM uses a complication in the game, and
the player responds by going along with it, the player gets a reward in the form of a hero point. This means that although
the hero has to deal with some “bad stuff” from time to time, there is an upside, and a reason for players to want their
characters’ complications to come into play! Why do powerful heroes lead such complicated lived? They need the points!

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

When  this  happens,  and  poses  a  challenge  for  you,
your complication comes into play.

Prejudice: You are part of a minority group subject
to  the  prejudices  of  others,  which  create  problems.
Similarly, characters with unusual origins or appear-
ance might face prejudice, such as a demonic-look-
ing hero who is considered suspect. Some Gamemas-
ters and gaming groups may prefer not to deal with
issues of prejudice in their games, in which case the
GM is free to ban this complication.

Quirk:  Complications  can  often  come  from  various
personality  quirks:  likes,  dislikes,  hobbies,  neuroses,
and  so  forth.  For  example,  a  hero  might  have  the
quirk of always leaving some sort of “calling card” for
the authorities along with a captured criminal. That
could become a complication if somebody else starts
imitating it, or uses it to cause trouble for the hero.

not even on your turn. Reactions don’t count against your
normal  allotment  of  actions  and  you  can  react  as  often
as the circumstances dictate, but only when they dictate.

Heroes  run  into  their  share  of  difficulties  in  their  work.
One way MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS measures this is with dif-
ferent  conditions.  They  are  shorthand  for  the  different
game modifiers imposed by things from power effects to
injuries or fatigue. So, for example, “vulnerable” is a condi-
tion where a hero’s active defenses are reduced. An oppo-
nent grabbing them or an entangling mass of glue might
make heroes vulnerable, or they might be made vulner-
able by a foe’s cunning combat maneuver or being caught
off-guard. The game effect is the same (the hero’s active
defenses  are  reduced),  so  it  is  easier  to  just  refer  to  the
overall condition as “vulnerable” and describe the differ-
ent situations that cause it.

This section describes the different conditions that can af-
fect characters in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS. If multiple condi-
tions apply, use all of their effects. Some conditions super-
sede other, lesser, conditions, as given in their descriptions.

Each  basic  condition  describes  a  single  game  modifier.
They are the “building blocks” of conditions, much as ef-
fects  are  the  basic  building  blocks  of  powers.  Indeed,
many  power  effects  reference  these  basic  conditions  in

the descriptions of what they do. See the Powers chapter
for details.

Compelled: A compelled character is directed by an
outside force, but struggling against it; the character
is limited to free actions and a single standard action
per turn, with both types of action being chosen by
another, controlling character. As usual, this standard
action  can  be  traded  for  a  move  action.  Controlled

CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS
CHAPTER 2: SECRET ORIGINS

The MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS Roleplaying Game allows you to create any sort of hero you want by choosing your character’s
abilities, skills, powers, and other traits. You have a “budget” of power points with which to build your hero. There are
also certain limits and guidelines imposed by the game’s power level, chosen by the Gamemaster, but within those
limits you can build a wide range of characters.

The quickest and easiest way to create your own MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS hero is to look through the various hero arche-
types on pages 35-49, choose one that fits the type of hero you want to play, and customize it to match your ideas. With
just a few quick choices, you have a new hero, complete and ready for the game!

Each archetype offers a complete, ready-to-play power level 10 hero, the recommended starting power level for MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS. Some archetypes offer a few simple choices in terms of skills, advantages, or sets of powers to fit different
themes. For example, many archetypes offer a choice of an Expertise skill to round out the character’s background and
interests outside of superheroism.

Some archetypes also offer an Options section, where you can change some of the pre-existing trait choices to create a
different kind of hero. For example, the Crime Fighter archetype has options for a hero with less equipment, but super-
human senses, or a special vehicle of some type. Other archetypes offer similar options.

Even if the archetype does not have an Options section that does not mean you cannot customize the archetype to suit
the type of hero you want to play! The archetypes are just starting points: if you are more familiar with character design
in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS, feel free to change any or all of your chosen archetype’s traits. So long as you stay within the
bounds of available power points, series power level, and your Gamemaster’s approval, you’re fine.

Please note, the characters on pages 35-49 include some Advantages in italicized print. Those advantages are from an
Enhanced Advantage effect listed in their powers.

Designing a hero from scratch in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS follows a series of simple steps, using the information presented
in the other chapters of this book. You’ll need a copy of the character sheet found in the back of the book (and also avail-
able online) and some scratch paper to design your character. If you’re pressed for time, looking for some inspiration,

appropriate type of check, a Difficulty Class, and make a
roll to see if the character succeeds or not! It’s that simple.

RANK

Every trait in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS —abilities, skills, pow-
ers, and so forth—has an associated rank, a value telling
you how strong (or weak) that trait is. Ranks run from –5
(very  weak)  all  the  way  up  to  20  (incredibly  strong)  or
more. You can rate virtually any trait by its rank. With the
correspondence of rank and measure, you can rate virtu-
ally  anything—distance,  weight,  time,  and  so  forth—by
rank.

Every  task—from  making  an  attack  to  avoiding  harm  to
figuring out a gadget—has a Difficulty Class or DC, a value
that tells you how hard that task is to perform. DCs range
from  0  (automatic,  so  easy  it’s  not  worth  rolling)  to  40
(nearly impossible).
CHECKS

Actions in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS are all resolved through
checks, a roll of a 20-sided die, plus a modifier. If the total
of the check equals or exceeds the Difficulty Class, the ac-
tion is a success. If it doesn’t, then it’s a failure.

Beneficial conditions apply a +2 bonus on the check (+5
for very highly beneficial), adverse conditions impose a –2
penalty (–5 for highly adverse). This is true whether you’re
trying to use a skill, make an attack, use a power, or what
have you.

Avoiding  an  effect  is  a  resistance  check,  with  a  Difficulty
Class of 10 + the effect’s modifier or rank. A successful re-
sistance means you avoid the effect, a failed check means
you suffer some (or all) of the effect.

THAT’S IT!

That’s the core of MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS: roll d20 + rank and
modifiers vs. a Difficulty Class. If you understand that, you
can do pretty much anything in the game. The rest is just
detail. When in doubt, or whenever you want to speed the
game along, just have a player make a check of the appro-
priate trait rank against a DC based on how difficult the
task is and you can’t really go wrong.

Part of the Gamemaster’s job is to make sure the game
is fair and balanced, so everyone can have a good time
and all the heroes have an equal chance of doing some

fun and exciting things in the course of the adventure. It
can be tricky sometimes, but MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS gives
you  tools  for  balancing  the  traits  of  the  heroes  against
different  challenges  and  handling  problems  that  may
come up.

One of your interaction skills is so effective you can cap-
ture  and  hold  other’s  attention  with  it.  Choose  Decep-
tion,  Intimidation,  or  Persuasion  when  you  acquire  this
advantage. You can also use Fascinate with an appropri-
ate  Expertise  skill,  like  musician  or  singer,  at  the  GM’s
discretion.

You  are  subject  to  the  normal  guidelines  for  interaction
skills, and combat or other immediate danger makes this
advantage  ineffective. Take  a  standard  action  and  make
an  interaction  skill  check  against  your  target’s  opposing
check (Insight or Will defense). If you succeed, the target is
entranced. You can maintain the effect with a standard ac-
tion each round, giving the target a new resistance check.
The effect ends when you stop performing, the target suc-
cessfully resists, or any immediate danger presents itself.
Like all interaction skills, you can use Fascinate on a group,
but  you  must  affect  everyone  in  the  group  in  the  same
way.

You may take this advantage more than once. Each time, it
applies to a different skill.

its normal damage and counts as the initial attack check
required to grab your opponent.

COMBAT

You  have  an  environment  you’re  especially  suited  for
fighting  in.  Examples  include  in  the  air,  underwater,  in
space, in extreme heat or cold, in jungles or woodlands,
and so forth. While you are in your favored environment,
you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack checks or your
active defenses. Choose at the start of the round whether
the bonus applies to attack or defense. The choice remains
until the start of your next round. This circumstance bonus
is not affected by power level.

SKILL

You have a particular type of opponent you’ve studied or
are especially effective against. It may be a type of creature
(aliens, animals, constructs, mutants, undead, etc.), a pro-
fession (soldiers, police officers, Yakuza, etc.) or any other
category  the  GM  approves.  Especially  broad  categories
like “humans” or “villains” are not permitted. You gain a +2
circumstance  bonus  on  Deception,  Intimidation,  Insight,
and Perception checks dealing with your Favored Foe. This
circumstance bonus is not limited by power level.

MOVEMENT

Movement effects allow characters to get around in vari-
ous  ways.  Some  provide  a  speed  rank  with  a  particular
form of movement—such as ground, air, or water—while
others offer different modes of movement, like walking on
walls or slithering along the ground like a snake.

Although  activating  a  movement  effect  is  typically  a  free
action, the character must still take a move action in order
to actually move using the effect. So, for example, the ac-
tion of the Flight effect is “free” and activating it grants the
character a Flight speed rank equal to the effect rank. Mov-
ing that speed rank still requires a move action, however.

SENSORY

Senses  in  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  are  grouped  into  sense
types, descriptors for how different sensory effects work. The
sense types, and some of the senses included in them, are:

•

•

•

•

•

Visual: normal sight, darkvision, infravision, low-light
vision, microscopic vision, ultravision, X-Ray vision

Auditory: normal hearing, sonar (accurate ultrason-
ic), ultrasonic hearing

Olfactory: normal smell and taste, scent

Tactile: normal touch, tremorsense

Radio: radio, radar (accurate radio)

•  Mental: mental awareness, Mind Reading, Precogni-

Sensory effects enhance or alter the senses. Some senso-
ry effects improve the user’s senses while others grant en-
tirely new senses or fool the senses in some way. Sensory
effects are typically a free action to activate and sustain, or
are permanent and always in effect.

•

tion, Postcognition

Special: This is the catchall for other sensory descrip-
tors  not  given  above,  including  unusual  senses  or
exotic descriptors like cosmic, gravitic, magical, and
so forth.

Using  powers  is  a  fairly  simple  matter.  Some  power  effects  work  automatically.  Others—particularly  those  affecting
other people—require some effort to use, like an attack check or a effect check. Powers affecting others allow resistance
checks against their effects.

In  some  cases,  you  may  be  required  to  make  an  effect
check  to  determine  how  well  an  effect  works.  A  power
check  is  just  like  any  other  check:  d20,  plus  the  power’s
rank,  plus  any  applicable  modifiers,  against  a  difficulty
class set by the Gamemaster. The results of various power
checks are described in this chapter.

Effect Check = d20 + rank +
modifiers vs. difficulty class

chapter). They have no Fortitude defense.

they are alive).

•

Presence: Creatures without Presence are unable to
interact and immune to interaction skills. They have
no Will defense.

Lacking an ability is –10 power points; that is, it gives the
character  an  additional  10  power  points  to  spend  else-
where,  similar  to  having  a  –5  rank  in  an  ability,  but  with
different  effects.  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  heroes  cannot  be
absent an ability without Gamemaster permission, as it can
have significant effects on the character and the game.

Fighting: A creature with no Fighting is incapable of
making any sort of close attack (but may still be able
to launch ranged attacks, if it has Dexterity).

Absent abilities cannot be weakened (see the Weaken ef-
fect in the Powers chapter) or debilitated, since they are
not present at all in the first place!

Intellect: A creature with no Intellect is an automa-
ton, lacking free will and operating entirely on simple
instinct  or  pre-programmed  instructions.  Anything
with no Intellect is immune to mental effects and in-
teraction skills and has no Will defense.

Awareness:  Anything  with  no  Awareness  is  com-
pletely unaware and also has no Presence. It is an in-
animate object, not a creature. Objects are immune
to mental effects and interaction skills, and have no

Inanimate  objects  have  no  abilities  other  than  their
Toughness. Animate, but nonliving, constructs such as ro-
bots or zombies have Strength, Agility, and Dexterity, and
may  have  ranks  of  Awareness  and  Presence  (if  aware  of
their environment or capable of interaction), and Fighting
(if able to make close attacks). They may have Intellect (if
capable  of  independent  thought),  but  have  no  Stamina
(since  they  are  not  living  things).  See  Constructs  in  the
Gadgets & Gear chapter for more information.

change things to make the outcome more interesting or
more in line with how the game should go. In the above
example,  you  might  decide  the  villain  is  only  dazed  or
stunned  rather  than  being  knocked  out,  momentarily
giving the heroes the upper hand, but not ending the cli-
matic encounter prematurely.

Isn’t this cheating? Well, yes, in a manner of speaking it
is, but it’s “cheating” in order to make the game more in-
teresting and fun for everyone involved. So long as you
don’t alter the outcome of die rolls unfairly or malicious-
ly  and  you  do  it  to  help  ensure  the  game  is  fun,  inter-
esting, and challenging, you shouldn’t have a problem.
Besides,  the  complication  system  of  MUTANTS  &  MASTER-
provides you with the perfect excuse to “cheat” to
help out the heroes’ adversaries from time to time, and
to  compensate  the  players  in  the  process  by  awarding
them hero points, which they, in turn, can use to “cheat”
the fickle die from time to time and ensure their heroes
succeed.

IT

Sometimes you’ll run into a situation the game rules don’t
cover, or that you’re not sure how to handle. In these cases,
feel free to just fake it. Come up with a check you feel suits
the situation and go with it, so you can keep the game mov-
ing rather than getting bogged down in page flipping and
rules arguments. One of the great things about the MUTANTS
& MASTERMINDS system is pretty much everything can be re-
solved with a simple check. So when all else fails, just have a
player make a check with the most appropriate trait (ability,
skill, or power). If the check beats your estimation of the Dif-
ficulty Class, it’s a success. Otherwise, it’s a failure.

You also can fake it when dealing with certain trivial situ-
ations in the game. If there’s an important piece of infor-
mation you want the players to know, don’t bother seeing
if  they  succeed  at  a  Perception  check.  You  can  pretend
to  make  the  checks,  then  ignore  the  results  and  tell  the
players what their heroes find. Likewise,  if  a  power  level
10 hero is going to take out a PL 3 thug, you don’t have
to make all the rolls. Just ask the player to describe how
the hero defeats the hapless thug. It’s pretty much going
to  happen  anyway,  and  there’s  no  reason  why  the  hero
shouldn’t look cool doing it.

The essence of the MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game system is

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

As you can see, once you break it down, checks are actual-
ly fairly simple. All the Gamemaster has to say in response
to the player’s declaration is: “Okay, roll a Fighting check
to hit the villain,” letting the rest of the description stand
as what happens. Whether or not the hero is successful in
stopping the trap depends on the outcome of the attack
against the bad guy.

Of course, if the villain is expecting the hero, there might be
another trap, such as part of the catwalk rigged to fall away
under him, leaving him dangling above the acid vat and at
the villain’s mercy! In that case, the GM would respond to
the  player’s  description: “You  smash  through  the  skylight
and swing over to the catwalk, but when you do...” and go
on to describe what follows. The rest of the hero’s intended
action(s) are null and void, because things don’t always go
as planned when you’re dealing with cunning supervillains!

Checks are used to resolve all outcomes in MUTANTS & MAS-
TERMINDS,  so  once  you  understand  the  basic  concept,  the
rest is easy. For detailed examples of how to use checks in
the game and their effects, see the Action & Adventure
chapter.

If  you  roll  a  20  on  the  die  when  making  a  check  you’ve
scored a critical success. Determine the degree of success
normally and then increase it by one degree. This can turn
a low-level success into something more significant, but
more importantly, it can turn a failure into a full-fledged
success! A critical success with an attack check is called a
critical hit, discussed later in this chapter and in the Ac-
tion & Adventure chapter.

Checks are made against a difficulty class or DC, a num-
ber set by the GM, which your check must equal or exceed
to achieve success. So for a task with a DC of 15 you must
roll a check total of 15 or greater to succeed. In some cas-
es, the results of a check vary based on how much higher
or lower the result is than the DC, known as its degree of
success or failure.

CHAPTER 6: POWERS
CHAPTER 6: POWERS

Although some heroes and villains rely solely on their skills and advantages, most are set apart by their superhuman
powers. MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS characters can lift tanks, fly through the air, throw lightning from their hands, shoot lasers
from their eyes, or any number of other amazing things. This chapter describes these and many other powers and how
you can create your own.

Players spend power points on various powers for their heroes, like acquiring skills or other traits. A power is made up of
one or more effects, possibly with different modifiers, which increase or decrease the cost of the effects.

Effects can be used to create any number of different powers. A hero with the Concealment effect (see page 153) could use
it to create a power called Blending, Blur, Cloak, Invisibility, Shadowmeld, or anything else appropriate to the character you
wish to play. It’s all a matter of how powerful the effect is and what modifiers have been placed on it to increase or decrease
its performance. Another way to think of it is that this book is filled with effects, but your character sheet is filled with powers.

Power  effects  are  acquired  in  ranks,  like  ranks  for  other
traits. The more ranks an effect has, the greater its effect.
Each effect of a power has a standard cost per rank.

MODIFIERS

Modifiers  change  how  an  effect  works,  making  it  more
effective  (an  extra)  or  less  effective  (a  flaw).  Modifiers
have ranks, just like other traits. Extras increase a power’s
cost while flaws decrease it. Some modifiers increase an
effect’s cost per rank, others apply an unchanging cost to
the power’s total; these are called flat modifiers. For more
information see Modifiers, on page 187.

The  final  cost  of  a  power  is  determined  by  base  effect
costs,  modified  by  extras  and  flaws,  multiplied  by  the
power’s rank, with flat modifiers applied to the total cost.

Power Cost = ((base effect costs + extras -
flaws) x rank) + flat modifiers

The rules in this chapter explain what the various powers do,
that is, what their game effects are, but it is left up to the play-
er and Gamemaster to apply descriptors to define exactly
what a power is and what it looks (and sounds, and feels) like
to observers beyond just a collection of game effects.

A power’s descriptors are primarily for color. It’s more inter-
esting and clear to say a hero has a “Flame Blast” or “Light-
ning  Bolt”  power  than  a  gene

CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR
CHAPTER 7: GADGETS & GEAR

From blaster rifles to anti-gravity belts, teleportation rings, and battlesuits, heroes and villains develop all manner of gad-
gets. Villains are forever coming up with doomsday machines and fiendish deathtraps while heroes use all sorts of gear
to aid them in their fight for justice. This chapter looks at various sorts of devices and equipment in MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS
game terms. It also describes vehicles, headquarters, and constructs, ranging from zombie minions to giant robots.

DEVICES

A device is an item that provides a particular power effect or set of effects. While devices are typically creations of ad-
vanced science, they don’t have to be. Many heroes and villains have magical devices such as enchanted weapons and
armor, magical talismans, wands and staves of power, and so forth. Some devices are products of alien technology so
advanced they might as well be magical, or focuses of psychic or cosmic power beyond the understanding of both
magic and science. All devices work the same way in game terms, regardless of their origin or descriptors.

Generally speaking, devices are powers with the Removable flaw applied to them (see Removable in the Powers chapter),
meaning the power is external to the character. Take away the device, and the wielder loses the ability to use those powers.
So if an armored hero loses access to his battlesuit, for example, he also loses access to the powers tied-up in it. The same
is the case of a hero loses a cosmic ring, magic helmet, or alien artifact, which is why Removable is a flaw for those powers.

Just like other powers, devices cost power points (albeit reduced some by the Removable flaw). Characters who want to
have and use a device on a regular basis have to pay power points to have it, just like having any other power. The device
becomes a part of the character’s abilities. If the device is lost, stolen, or destroyed, the character can replace it, given
time, since the device is considered a permanent part of the character. Only a re-allocation of the character’s power
points will change this, and Gamemasters should allow characters to re-allocate power points spent on a Removable
power if it is somehow permanently lost.

In other cases, characters may make temporary use of a device. Most devices are usable by anyone able to operate
them, in which case characters may loan devices to each other, or may pick up and use someone else’s device (or even
steal a

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

One player—the Gamemaster or “GM”—takes responsibility for running a MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game. The Game-
master  creates  the  adventure,  runs  the  players  through  it,  takes  on  the  roles  of  the  various  other  characters  the
heroes encounter, and handles any questions about the rules as they arise. The Gamemaster also adjudicates the
process of character creation, deciding what traits, modifiers, and so forth are appropriate for the particular game,
along with the best way to express certain concepts in game terms. While Gamemastering is a big responsibility, it’s
not as hard as it might seem, and providing a fun and entertaining game for your friends can be quite rewarding.

While the players are responsible for keeping track of their characters and deciding on their actions, the Gamemaster is
responsible for everything else that happens in the game. A good GM tries to make sure the game runs as smoothly as
possible and is enjoyable for all of the players. Many components go into creating a good MUTANTS & MASTERMINDS game.
The following sections give you the basics, but experience is the best tool to help you become a better Gamemaster.

can  be  broken  down  into  a  series
of tasks the heroes must perform, from piecing together
clues  about  a  villain’s  latest  scheme  to  blasting  said  vil-
lain through a wall and disarming his doomsday device in
the nick of time. It’s up to the Gamemaster to assign the
difficulty of these and numerous other tasks in the game
and to determine the outcome of the heroes’ efforts. This
section  offers  some  general  guidelines  on  assigning  the
difficulty of a task.

THE 55% RULE

tract 10 from the DC. So a DC 25 action (a formidable task)
requires a bonus of +15 in order to have a 55% chance of
success (on a roll of 10 or higher).

Keep in mind that this chance of success on a task allows
a character to automatically succeed at that task as a rou-
tine  check  (see  Routine  Checks,  following,  and  in  The
Basics chapter). This is intentional; the average character
only really fails at an average task when hurried or under
stress. A 55% chance also allows a player to spend a hero
point to automatically succeed, since a hero point ensures
a die roll of at least 11. (See Hero Points, page 20.)

A good guideline to keep in mind is the chance of an aver-
age character (with a modifier of 0) succeeding

Accident:  The  Mystic  commands  incredible  super-
natural powers, but sometimes those powers get out
of control, or awaken sleeping horrors, or cause other
unintended consequences that have to be dealt with.

Enemy: Some Mystics are plagued by enemies who
want to displace them or steal their power.

Honor:  It’s  not  uncommon  for  a  Mystic  to  follow  a
code of conduct that keeps them on the straight and
narrow,  perhaps  because  it’s  the  right  thing  to  do,
perhaps because they need to in order to keep their
powers in check.

•  Motivation—Acceptance:  Mystics  are  often  either
not from Earth or were trained in the mystic arts on
another  world. When  they  come  to  this  plane  they
use their talents to help others and hopefully earn a
place for themselves on their adopted world.

•  Motivation—Responsibility: The Mystic was given
his  or  her  power  for  a  reason—to  defend  Earth,  to
hunt down otherworldly creatures, or any number of
other options. Or perhaps the Mystic recognizes that
his or her power comes with a price.

Power  Loss:  Mystics  often  have  the  Complication
that  prevents  them  from  using  their  powers  when
they can’t move and/or speak to cast their spells.

Prejudice: Some Mystics are surrounded by an aura
of “otherness”  that  sets  them  apart  from  the  rest  of
humanity and makes it difficult for them to interact
with others. Or, maybe people just fear witches.

Paragons are what people first think of when they think

CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING
CHAPTER 9: GAMEMASTERING

265

More  than  a  few  comic  books  speculate  about  the  fu-
ture. There are science fiction comics aplenty, along with
super-hero stories set at different points in Earth’s future.

A near future setting may be quite similar to the modern-
day, with the addition of some new technology and the
new problems that come with it. For example there may
be flying cars, cybernetic and genetic modifications, and
advances  in  computer  technology  along  with  increases
in crime and urban decay. Heroes can stalk the streets of
dark, towering cities trying to protect the innocent where
a corrupt legal system has failed.

Some  future  comic  stories  are  set  following  a  terrible
catastrophe  that  has  all  but  destroyed  civilization.  In  a
setting  like  this  the  heroes  may  be  the  last  survivors  of
ordinary  humanity,  or  super-powered  mutants,  trained
super-soldiers (perhaps intended as weapons in the Last
War), or even cyborgs or aliens. Their adventures tend to
revolve around protecting pockets of civilization from ma-
rauding  mutants  and  keeping  ambitious  warlords  from
conquering the world or destroying innocent people.

Far future settings feature faster-than-light space travel, al-
lowing heroes to visit (or come from) any of dozens or even
hundreds  of  different  worlds.  A  team  made  up  of  heroes
from  these  different  worlds  could  band  together  to  pro-
tect the interstellar government from hostile alien invaders
while also dealing with disasters, space pirates, and crimi-
nal  cartels.  Or  a  group  can  explore  the  unknown  reaches
of space on board a starship, encountering would-be con-
querors, despots, raiders, and other villains along the way.

STYLE

Just as comics themselves span the stylistic gamut from
lighthearted  adventure  to  intricately  plotted,  grim  mo-
rality  plays,  so  can  a  MUTANTS  &  MASTERMINDS  series  vary  in
style. Once a style of play is established, it’s up to the GM
to  maintain  it.  That  means  creating  adventures  and  en-
counters suited to that style and encouraging the players
to get into the style’s mindset and run their characters ac-
cordingly. Styles run along a spectrum from light to dark:

LIGHT

The light style is simple and straightforward. The heroes
are the good guys and the villains are usually bad through
and  through  (with  a  few  misunderstood  souls  in  need
of help). Problem solving is a matter of eith
