  Teaches Patton-style story mapping: epics, sub-epics, stories, verb–noun naming, and
  actors via story_type. When building a map from sources, outputs **all** template
  artifacts in `templates/` (currently `story-map.md` and `story-map.txt`) with the
  same tree — not one or the other. Use when structuring product discovery, decomposing
  user journeys, identifying epics and flows, story mapping, organizing requirements
  into a hierarchical map, or when the user mentions story maps, epics, sub-epics, or
  Jeff Patton–style backlog structure.

# abd-story-mapping

## Purpose: 
Describe what a good story map *is* (concepts and naming). **How** to run the bot, workspace setup, and step-by-step CLI belong in the agent and other skills — not here.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when **any** of the following apply:

- You need to capture goals, decompose user journeys, or capture a solution as a set of user–system interactions (stories grouped into epics).
- A user or agent wants to restructure sources of context (eg: requirements docs, interviews, a product brief, or even a rough description) into a new or existing story map.
- An agent is asked to "map out the system", "identify the epics", "structure the work", or "figure out what we're building using stories"
- You want to organize existing code, solutions, or tests into a hierarchical story-map format.

## Agent Instructions

1. **Templates**

Generate content using **every** template file in this skill’s `templates/` folder. **Do not** emit only Markdown or only plain text unless the user **explicitly** asks for a single format.

**Use every template file (required)**

When you **create or rewrite** a story map from requirements, you **must** deliver **one output artifact per file** in `templates/`.

| Template | What to produce |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/story-map.md` | The epic/sub-epic/story tree using that layout. Optional title or short context above the tree is fine. **Do not** paste the template’s notation / `## Instructions` section (or equivalent) into generated project files — that material documents the template for skill maintainers, not stakeholders reading the map. |
| `templates/story-map.txt` | The **same** hierarchy and semantics as **plain text** only — tree lines matching `story-map.txt` style. |

**Consistency:** Connectors (`or`, `opt`), nested `(AC)` lines, and actor/story lines must match between `.md` and `.txt` for the same map. Generated artifacts contain **only** the map (plus optional brief context in `.md`); notation rules stay in this skill and in `templates/story-map.md` for reference.

**If new files are added** under `templates/` later, produce a corresponding artifact for **each** new template the same way.

**Depth:** Stay at epic / sub-epic / story hierarchy and ordering unless another workflow adds acceptance criteria or scenarios.

**Quality bar:** Match the naming and layout expectations in **Core concepts** and **The shape of a good story map** below.

**Where it lives:** In a project, the map is often mirrored in **`docs/story/story-graph.json`** (or the workspace’s graph path) via **story-graph-ops** or the bot; this skill still treats **`story-map.md`** and **`story-map.txt`** as the template-aligned outputs you author first.

2. **Rules**

- Generate content following the rules attached to this skill (listed below, assembled from **`rules/*.md`**).
- After content exists, act as a *peer reviewer*: walk each rule’s constraints, DO/DON’T sections, and examples; be helpful but critical when comparing the deliverable to each rule.

- **Who is checking:** A **product owner** (scope and outcomes), a **developer** (clarity and testability of behaviors), and a **domain expert** (language and flows) should all agree on what the map says.
- **Cross-artifact parity:** The `.md` and `.txt` trees must match (connectors, nesting, actors on story lines).

3. **Assembling this skill**

This **`SKILL.md`** is assembled from **`rules/`** into the bundled block below. Use **`bundle_rules_into_skill_md.py`** from **`skills/execute_using_rules/scripts/`** whenever **`rules/*.md`** changes:

## What is a story map?

A **story map** is a visual, hierarchical model of how users and systems interact with a product or service. It was popularized by Jeff Patton and is central to Agile by Design's approach to discovery.

A story map answers three questions:
1. **Who** uses the system? (Actors)
2. **What** are the major capability areas? (Top Level Epics)
3. **How** do users move through those areas, step by step? (Lower Level Epics and Stories)

Story maps are intentionally **not implementation plans**. They describe *outcomes and behaviors*, not tasks, tickets, or technical steps, although they can be used to describe system to system interactions and complex system behaviors. A good story map can be understood by a product owner, a developer, and a domain expert — all at once.

### Why story map?

A story map is a **collaborative method** to break work down. It provides a structure to guide collaborative thought in order to achieve **shared understanding** — alignment from more than one perspective, the engineering team, the product and stakeholders affected by the product. It is a method to break down *what you are working on*, not *the way you work*.

The perpsective provided by a story map is **cross-functional**: SMEs, analysts, developers, testers, delivery lead — various viewpoints that together produce a more complete picture than any individual could. Story maps are useful when a project, initiative, or product is in discovery and the scope of functions, features, and goals needs to be flushed out and understood.

---

## Core concepts

### Actors

An **actor** is anyone (or anything) that interacts with the system. Actors are the *who* behind every story.

| Actor type | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **User** | A human who uses the system directly | Customer, Administrator, Agent |
| **System** | An external system or automated process | Payment gateway, Email service, Scheduler |

Actors do NOT appear in story names — they are captured in the `story_type` field and optionally in `notes`. The name describes the *behavior*, not who does it.

### Personas

A **persona** is a representative description of a segment of customers or users. Personas create a unified view of who the target is and their needs, and model customer behaviour based on validated information.

Before building the map, identify the personas from the available context. For each persona determine their goals and the activities they need to meet those goals — these drive the epics and stories below.

In the story map, personas sit at the **top layer** — each persona's goals drive the epics below them. Actors in `story_type` may map to one or more personas.

---

### Epics

An **epic** is a major **capability area** of the system — a broad theme that groups related user journeys together.

Epics answer: *"What is this area of the product responsible for?"*

- They are not **user stories** — they are containers for flows
- A medium sized system typically has 3–8 top level epics
- Named in **verb-noun format**: `Manage Customer Orders`, `Track Fleet Vehicles`, `Process Payments`
- Each epic spans the entire left-to-right axis of the story map at the top level

**Good:** Manage Customer Orders, Process Online Payments. **Weak:** Orders, Backend, Admin.

---

### Epic Hierarchy

Top level epics often have one or more layers of children epics, often called **sub-epic**.  Each sub-epic is often a **flow or feature area** within that epic — a coherent sequence of interactions that achieves a meaningful outcome.

Sub-epics answer: *"What are the distinct flows or phases within this capability area?"*

- A sub-epic often maps to a user journey (e.g., "place an order" is a flow within "manage orders")
- Each sub-epic groups the stories that belong to that flow
- Also named in **verb-noun format**: `Place New Order`, `Review Order History`, `Cancel Order`
- Sub-epics can nest (a flow can have sub-flows), but depth will likely be shallow — 1–2 levels usually enough, unless the system is quite large.

**Good:** Place New Order, Review Order History. **Weak:** Order flow, Checkout stuff.

---

### Stories

A **story** is a **discrete, observable behavior** — a single thing a user or system does within a flow.

Stories answer: *"What is the specific action or interaction happening here?"*

- Stories are the leaves of the story map — they cannot be decomposed further at this stage
- Each story should be independently testable in principle
- **Verb + noun** (e.g. Place Order, Validate Payment). Put the actor in `story_type`, not in the title.
- Stories are behaviors, not tasks — “call the payments API” is a task; “process payment” is a story.

**Good:** Place Order, Select Delivery Address, Validate Payment. **Weak:** Customer Places Order; Payment Processing; Selects Tokens; API call; button click.

Prefer what happens over how it is shown — **Show order confirmation** beats **Displaying order confirmation** as the main verb.

#### Story types

| `story_type` | Meaning | Style in diagram |
|---|---|---|
| `user` | Human user | Yellow |
| `system` | External or automated system | Dark blue |
| `technical` | Infra, background jobs, non-visible | Black |

Use **user** and **system** for normal product behavior. **technical** (black) sparingly — only when someone explicitly wants that on the map.

---

### Notes on context capture

If useful detail does not fit a node name, put it in that node’s `notes` and cite the source (file, page, section, or `"type": "chat"`). Check `notes` before re-reading raw sources when you continue work on the same map.

---

### Pitfalls for agents

**Assess context coverage before mapping.** Before building or extending a story map, check whether the available context covers the perspectives needed: product/business intent, technical constraints, operational concerns, and user experience. If an entire dimension is absent (e.g. no technical input on system interactions, or no business rules for a domain area), flag it as a gap. A map built from a single perspective will churn when the missing viewpoint surfaces.

**Don't fabricate to fill gaps.** When context is incomplete — a business rule is unclear, a system boundary is unknown, a domain has no source material — do not invent stories or structure to cover the gap. Capture what is missing, state your assumption, and recommend a validation action (e.g. "confirm with product owner whether returns follow the same flow as exchanges"). Unknowns surfaced honestly are more valuable than a plausible-looking map that turns out to be wrong.

### Recording context gaps in the story map

Context gaps must be captured **inside the story map output files** (`story-map.md` and `story-map.txt`) so they travel with the map. Use one or both placements depending on scope:

**Inline gaps** — when a gap applies to a specific epic, sub-epic, or story, place a `* Gap:` line indented under that node:

```
(E) Direct Mob Combat
    (E) Assign Mob Strategy
        (S) GM --> Select Mob Strategy
        * Gap: Is the strategy list extensible by the GM, or fixed?
    (E) Execute Mob Attack
        (S) System --> Resolve Melee Attack
```

**Map-level gaps** — when a gap applies to the whole map or cuts across multiple areas, place a `## Context Gaps` section at the bottom of the file:

```
## Context Gaps
- No technical input on Foundry VTT module API constraints.
- Single perspective (GM only); no QA or dev viewpoint yet.
```

Use **inline** when the gap is local to a node; use **map-level** when it is broad. Both can appear in the same file. The `.md` and `.txt` outputs must include the same gaps in the same positions.

---

### Iterating the map

Do not treat the map as a one-shot deliverable. Deeper analysis will surface information that invalidates earlier structure — stories split, epics merge, flows reorder. This is expected.

When new context arrives or downstream work (AC, scenarios, tests) exposes gaps, revise the map rather than working around stale structure. Keep the map lightweight enough that restructuring is cheap.

Apply progressive depth:

- **Idea Shaping** — barely enough structure to scope the work and assign it.
- **Increment Discovery** — cursory scan for breadth, priority, and rough complexity.
- **Story Refinement** — detail out stories for the next increment; leave later increments shallow.

Do not over-elaborate areas the team will not build soon. Go deep where uncertainty is highest or delivery is imminent.

---

## Example

```
Epic: Manage Customer Orders
  └── Sub-Epic: Place New Order
        ├── Story: Browse Product Catalog         [user]
        ├── Story: Add Item To Cart             [user]
        ├── Story: Enter Shipping Address       [user]
        ├── Story: Select Delivery Option       [user]
        └── Story: Submit Order                 [user]
  └── Sub-Epic: Track Order Status
        ├── Story: View Current Order Status    [user]
        └── Story: Receive Shipment Notification [system]
  └── Sub-Epic: Cancel Order
        ├── Story: Cancel Order Request         [user]
        └── Story: Process Cancellation Refund [system]
```

Notice:

- Epics are **wide** — they span the whole capability area
- Sub-epics are **flows** — each tells a coherent mini-story
- Stories are **small** — one behavior each; names are verb–noun; actor only in `story_type`

---

---

## Validate

**Goal:** Inspect what was built — read the artifacts as reviewers, not a second authoring pass.


Checklist:

- **Hierarchy** — epics → sub-epics → stories; **verb–noun** names; actors only in `story_type`, not in titles.
- **Story size** — one observable behavior per story; flows grouped in sub-epics.
- **Intent** — outcomes and behaviors, not implementation tasks, tickets, or internal structure spelled out as “stories.”

### Rule: Active Business and Behavioral Language

**Scanner:** `scanners/active-business-and-behavioral-language-scanner.py` — **`ActiveBusinessAndBehavioralLanguageScanner`**


Use **active** business language focused on **user/system behavior**: clear action verbs, not technical implementation or passive constructions.

#### DO

- Use **active voice** with business language and **base verb forms** (infinitive/imperative): e.g. `User --> submit order`, `System --> validate payment`, `Customer --> place order`, `Admin --> approve request`.
- Prefer **action verbs** that describe behavior: submit, view, validate, send, display, place, edit, create, load, save, invoke, process, generate, update — as fits the story.
- Prefer **user/system stories** over raw technical tasks. Rephrase technical wording into business behavior (e.g. `System --> store user data` rather than “set up database schema”). When technical work is required, use `story_type: technical` and keep it minimal.
- When technical stories are necessary, mark with **`story_type: technical`** and keep them focused.

#### DON'T

- **Passive or vague:** not “Order is submitted” — use `User --> submit order`. Not “Payment gets validated” — use `System --> validate payment`.
- **Implementation/task language** as the main story: avoid “write code”, “create class”, “set up CI/CD”, “configure database” as the behavior — express **business outcome** instead where possible.
- **Development-task verbs** for primary stories: implement feature, create module, refactor code, fix bug, build system — unless framed as real behavioral outcomes with `story_type` as appropriate.

### Rule: Consolidate Superficial Stories

**Scanner:** Manual review (policy; pairs with *Review and Expand Stories* — see below)


Consolidate stories that differ **only superficially** (same logic, different data values or enumeration). Combine into **one parameterized story** where it applies.

**Relationship to other rules:** This rule removes **data-value duplication** (same behavior, different inputs). *Review and Expand Stories* splits by **component behavior**. Apply **consolidation first**, then expansion if you still need component-level depth.

#### DO

- Merge stories that share the same validation logic but differ only by the value validated (e.g. six ability scores → one **`Assign Ability (STR, DEX, …)`** story).
- Merge stories that share the same calculation but differ only by attribute (e.g. multiple “calculate X modifier” → **`Calculate Ability Modifiers`**).
- Merge the same operation across entity types when only the type differs (e.g. create character / weapon / armor → **`Create Game Entity (types…)`**).

#### DON'T

- Enumerate every permutation when logic is identical and only data changes — use one parameterized story (e.g. one **`Validate Input Format`** for email, phone, postal code).
- Split by data value when business rules are the same (e.g. separate add-book / add-electronics / add-clothing → **`Add Product`**).
- One story per status when the **workflow pattern** is the same — prefer one **`Update Order Status`** story with allowed values.

### Rule: Lightweight and Precise

**Scanner:** Manual review

Create **lightweight but precise** documentation during shaping. Focus on structure and scope, not detailed specifications.

#### DO

Make the map easy to walk through — it tells a story. Show hierarchy and flow without detailed specifications.

```
(E) Manage Orders
  (SE) Place Order
    (S) Validate Order Items
  (SE) Review Order
    (S) View Order Summary
    (S) Modify Order Items
```

This shows hierarchy and flow — that is enough at shaping stage.

#### DON'T

Do not add:
- Detailed API specs
- Database schema
- UI mockups
- Validation rules with detail
- Technical implementation notes

Example of over-elaboration (wrong at shaping):
```
(E) Manage Orders
  → Detailed API specs: POST /orders with JSON body {item_id, quantity, customer_id}
  → Database: orders table with FK to customers
  → UI: Modal with item picker and quantity stepper
```

If you have this kind of detail from context, put it in `notes` with a `context_source` citation — not in the story structure itself.

### Rule: Outcome-Oriented Language

**Scanner:** `scanners/outcome-oriented-language-scanner.py` — **`OutcomeOrientedLanguageScanner`**

Use **outcome-oriented language** over mechanism-oriented language. Focus on what is created or achieved, not how it is shown or communicated.

**Alignment with other rules:** Outcomes still use **base verb forms** (verb–noun, imperative style after `Actor -->`), matching **Verb–Noun Format** and **Active Business and Behavioral Language**. Do not fix a mechanism title by switching to third person (`provides…`, `displays…`) or gerunds (`Showing…`) in the action phrase.

#### DO

Name concepts by what they **ARE** or **CREATE**. Ask: _What is being created? What does the user get?_ Phrase the story as **`Actor --> verb` + object** (same pattern as **Active Business and Behavioral Language**), not gerund-led or third-person labels.

| Wrong (mechanism / gerund title) | Correct (outcome, base verb) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `Visualizing Power Activation` | `System --> display power activation animation` |
| `Showing Combat Results` | `System --> provide combat outcome feedback` |
| `Displaying Hit Information` | `System --> display hit indicators` |
| `Presenting Configuration Options` | `System --> load configuration panel` |
| `Providing Settings` | `System --> load configuration` |

#### DON'T

Avoid generic communication/mechanism verbs that describe *how* something is shown rather than *what* is created:

- `Showing results`
- `Displaying information`
- `Visualizing data`
- `Presenting options`
- `Providing settings`
- `Enabling features`
- `Allowing access`

### Rule: Review and Expand Stories

**Scanner:** Manual review (policy; pairs with *Consolidate Superficial Stories* — see below)


When planning calls for **system stories** or explicit **component interactions**, **decompose** existing stories into those interactions. Story count **will increase**.

**Relationship to other rules:** This rule expands by **component behavior** (different behaviors inside one flow). *Consolidate Superficial Stories* merges **same logic, different data**. Apply **consolidation first**, then **this expansion** where needed.

#### DO

- With System / Technology / Infrastructure emphasis, split user stories into **user action + system/component** stories (e.g. `User --> group tokens`, `System --> create mob`, `System --> assign mob leader`).
- **Review** existing stories and add component steps for payment, validation, inventory, etc., when the approach requires it.
- Break flows into **discrete system steps** when the plan demands (e.g. `validate payment` → `call payment gateway` → `persist transaction` → `confirm payment`).

#### DON'T

- Keep **one** user story when the approach requires visible **component** interactions.
- Assume story count stays fixed after switching to a **finer** system/component approach — expect a larger map.

### Rule: Scale Story Map by Domain

**Scanner:** `scanners/scale-story-map-by-domain-scanner.py` — **`ScaleStoryMapByDomainScanner`**


**Domain first, operation second.** At small scale, related domains can share a sub-epic. As behavior diverges, split into **parallel sub-epics by domain** with **consistent** stories under each. After expanding stories (*review and expand stories*), **organize by domain**, not by technology layer.

#### DO

- At **small** scale, keep related domain objects together when behavior is similar and story count is low.
- As **complexity** grows, break out **by domain** with parallel structure (e.g. wire / ACH / check each with collect → validate → submit, plus domain-specific extras).
- Scale along **domain object** first; **operations** are stories **within** each domain.
- After component-level expansion, place stories under **domain** sub-epics, not under generic tech buckets.

#### DON'T

- Group primarily by **operation** or **technology** at scale (e.g. one “validate all payments” mixing domains; “database operations” as a layer).
- **Over-split** early (many sub-epics for a handful of stories). **Under-specify** sub-epics as bare nouns — keep **verb–noun** flow names where they help (e.g. “Make Wire Payment” not just “Wire Transfer”).

### Rule: Small and Testable

**Scanner:** `scanners/small-and-testable-scanner.py` — **`SmallAndTestableScanner`**

Stories must be **testable as complete interactions** and deliverable independently. Small enough to test, large enough to matter.

#### DO

Each story must:
- Have clear acceptance criteria
- Be testable without parent context
- Represent a complete enough behavior to verify
- Be small enough to test quickly

**STORY vs STEP distinction:**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Story | User/system outcome — testable independently | `User --> save story graph` |
| Step | Implementation detail — part of parent test | `convert format`, `serialize to JSON`, `write file` |

Examples:
- Story: `User --> render diagram` → Steps (not separate stories): `generate XML`, `calculate positions`, `apply styles`

#### DON'T

- Create stories too small to test meaningfully
- Turn implementation steps into stories

Implementation operation patterns that are **steps, not stories**:
- `Serialize`, `deserialize`, `convert`, `transform`, `format`
- `Calculate`, `compute`, `generate` (technical artifacts)
- `Apply`, `set`, `configure` (technical settings)
- `Save`, `write`, `store` (without user context)

Examples of wrong stories:
- ~~`Add order button`~~ (can't test without full order flow)
- ~~`Convert Diagram to StoryGraph Format`~~ (implementation step)
- ~~`Serialize Components to JSON`~~ (not testable alone)
- ~~`Calculate Component Positions`~~ (no user outcome)

### Rule: Story Map from Existing Code

**Scanner:** _(none in JSON — methodological guidance for code-to-map workflows)_


When deriving a story map from **code**, start from **entry points**, derive operations and **goals**, then **epics/sub-epics/stories** — not from class names alone.

#### DO

1. **Entry points** — CLI commands, UI handlers, MCP tools, APIs, acceptance tests.
2. **Operations** — list and group by functional purpose.
3. **Epics from goals** — group operations by higher-order goals (e.g. CLI entry points `render-outline`, `render-increments` → goal **Render StoryGraph** → epic **`Render StoryGraph`**).
4. **Sub-epics from behaviors** — e.g. under **Render StoryGraph** → **`Render Outline`**, **`Render Increments`** (verb–noun, same bar as **Verb–Noun Format**).
5. **Story journey** — trace flow start → middle → end; include when/why/outcome/actor and error paths where relevant.

#### DON'T

- Start from **internal classes** or mirror **class structure** as epics.
- Turn **every method** into a story.
- Omit **context** (when/why/outcome) or elevate **implementation detail** as if it were user-visible behavior.

### Rule: Verb–Noun Format

**Scanner:** `scanners/verb-noun-format-scanner.py` — **`VerbNounFormatScanner`**


Use verb–noun format at every level. Document the actor separately (e.g. `story_type`, metadata)—**not** in the name. Prefer **base verb forms** (imperative / infinitive style: `Place Order`, `Select Tokens`), not gerunds (`Placing Order`) or third-person singular (`Places` / `Selects` as the *wrong* pattern when the rule asks for base form—see examples below).

#### DO

- **Format:** `verb` + `noun` [optional qualifiers]. Actor is separate. Use specific objects and context. Focus on what can be *done*, not what things *are*.

| Level | Examples (from rule) |
|--------|----------------------|
| Epic | `Manage Customer Orders`, `Process Online Payments` |
| Sub-Epic | `Place New Order`, `Validate Credit Card Payment` |
| Story (action phrasing) | `Process Order Payment`, `Validate Submitted Payments` — tie to lifecycle: Load → Read → Edit → Render → Synchronize → Search → Save |
| Story (system examples) | `Load Order Data`, `Validate Payment`, `Generate XML` |
| With actor (actor not in name) | `Place Order` (actor: Customer), `Validate Payment` (actor: System), `Update Stock` (actor: Inventory Manager) |
| Base verb form | `Select Tokens`, `Group Minions`, `Process Payment` — not `Selects Tokens`, not `Selecting Tokens` |

#### DON'T

- **Actor in the name:** e.g. not `Customer Places Order` → use `Place Order` and set actor in metadata. Same for `OrderProcessor Validates Payment` → `Validate Payment`; `Cart Adds Product` → `Add Product`.

- **Too generic or noun-only:** e.g. `Process Payment` without context when specificity is needed; `Payment Processing` (noun-only); `Order Management` (capability, not a concrete action); `Selects Tokens` (wrong verb form for this rule → `Select Tokens`).

- **Capability / structure phrasing instead of actions:** e.g. `PaymentValidator Contains Validation Logic`, `Cart Hierarchy Foundation`, `Product Represents Item`.

- **Transforming “capability” into action (examples from rule):** `Contains Logic` → e.g. `Generate XML`, `Render Diagram`; `Tracks Count` → `Read Count`, `Update Count`; `Represents X` → `Create X`, `Load X`.
