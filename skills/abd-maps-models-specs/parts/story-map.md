# Story Map Format

## Hierarchy

Epic → Sub-Epic → Story → Scenario → Step

| Node | Meaning | Heading |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Epic | Large domain capability — a major area of the system | `# Epic: <name> (<statement>)` |
| Sub-Epic | Logical grouping of related stories — a feature area, not a behavior itself | `## Epic: <name> (<statement>)` |
| Story | Smallest independently valuable behavior — has a triggering actor, a responding actor, and produces observable state change. If it has no actor and no state change, it is not a story. | `### Story: <name> (<statement>)` |
| Scenario | A condition-specific grouping of steps within a story (e.g. success path, failure path) | `#### Scenario: <name>` |
| Step | A single atomic interaction — one action by one actor | `- Step N: <name> (When/Then <statement>)` |

## Per Interaction

- **Trigger** — Triggering-Actor, Behavior
- **Response** — Responding-Actor, Behavior
- **Pre-Condition** — label only (Given/And)
- **Failure-Modes** — bullet list, max 3; rule/state based only (no infrastructure failures)
- **Domain Concepts** - Domain Concepts related to Interaction, must exist in the domain model
- **Examples** — tables per concept


### Commonly Generated Fields Per Node

| Node | Commonly Generated | Case-by-Case |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| Epic | Triggering-Actor, Responding-Actor, Name, Pre-Condition | Constraints |
| Story | Trigger, Response, Name, Examples, Pre-Condition, Failure-Modes | Constraints |
| Scenario | Trigger, Response, Pre-Condition, Examples | |
| Step | Trigger, Response, Examples | Constraints (when step-specific) |

## Domain Grounding

Use `**Concept**` in labels. Every concept must exist in Domain Model.

## Inheritance

Parent → child; use `[brackets]` for inherited values (e.g. `Triggering-Actor: [User]`).

## Example Tables

Tables live on the interaction. One per concept referenced in labels, should be identical to examples in the domain model

```
ConceptName (qualifier):
| scenario | field1 | field2 |
|----------|--------|--------|
| success  | val1   | val2   |

AnotherConcept (qualifier):
| scenario | field1 |
|----------|--------|
| success  | val1   |
```

- Qualifier in parentheses after concept name
- Scenario column required; use kebab-case (e.g. `success`, `invalid-details`)
- `===` separator between tables
- Inherited examples: `Examples: [Table Name 1, Table Name 2]`

## Validation Checklist

**Epic**
- [ ] Heading: `# Epic: <name using **Domain Concepts**> (<statement>)`
- [ ] Triggering-Actor, Responding-Actor, Pre-Condition, Examples present (or inherited)
- [ ] Pre-Condition on parent only when shared; children list only new or specialized state

**Story**
- [ ] Heading: `### Story: <name using **Domain Concepts**> (<statement>)`
- [ ] Pre-Condition, Failure-Modes (max 3), Trigger, Response present
- [ ] Trigger: sub-bullets Triggering-Actor, Behavior
- [ ] Response: sub-bullets Responding-Actor, Behavior

**Step**
- [ ] `- Step N: <name using **Domain Concepts**> (When/Then <statement>)`
- [ ] Trigger and Response with [inherited] when from parent

**Example tables**
- [ ] Qualifier in parentheses: `ConceptName (qualifier):`
- [ ] Scenario column required; kebab-case
- [ ] Each table: label, header row, separator row, data rows

**Hierarchy**
- [ ] Epic → Epic/Story → Scenario → Step
- [ ] Each node touches at least one domain concept via `**Concept**`
