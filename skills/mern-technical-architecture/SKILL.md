  Domain-first MERN web applications: domain modules, shared logic, Clean Architecture layers, story-driven tests, scanner-verified compliance.
description: >-
  Generate production MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) web applications
  using a domain-first architecture. Code is organized by business capability
  (domain module) with shared domain logic, Clean Architecture layer separation,
  and story-driven testing across three tiers. This skill covers the full
  structure: domain entities and Zod schemas in shared/, Express backend in
  server/, React frontend in client/, and Gherkin-aligned tests. Use it when
  scaffolding a new MERN project, adding a domain module, reviewing architecture
  compliance, or transforming a technically-organized codebase into domain-first
  structure. Produces TypeScript module output from templates and validates
  against embedded scanner-backed rules.

# mern-technical-architecture

## Purpose

Generate production MERN web applications using a **domain-first architecture** — organizing by business capability, sharing domain logic across tiers, enforcing Clean Architecture layer purity, and testing with story-driven scenarios.

This skill produces real, runnable TypeScript domain modules — each with a `shared/` domain core, `server/` Express backend, and `client/` React frontend. The output follows the architecture defined in [`inputs/mern-architecture.md`](inputs/mern-architecture.md): domain entities with business logic, Zod validation schemas shared across tiers, collection classes with domain-oriented query methods, and story-driven tests mirroring Gherkin scenarios.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when **any** of the following apply:

- You are **scaffolding a new MERN project** and need the domain-first folder structure.
- You are **adding a new domain module** (e.g., recipients, payments, invoices) to an existing project.
- You are **reviewing architecture compliance** against Clean Architecture and domain-first principles.
- You are **transforming** a technically-organized codebase (`controllers/`, `models/`, `views/`) into domain-first structure.
- You are generating **shared domain logic** (entities, schemas, value objects) that must work identically on client and server.
- You are setting up **story-driven tests** across server, client, and E2E tiers.

---

## Agent Instructions

1. **Read the architecture reference first** — Load [`inputs/mern-architecture.md`](inputs/mern-architecture.md) to understand the authoritative architecture: 5 layers, domain-first file structure, shared logic strategies, testing pyramid, and example code.

2. **Templates**
   Generate content using **every** template file in this skill's `templates/` folder.
   **Do not** emit only partial output unless the user **explicitly** asks for a single tier.

   | Template | What to produce |
   | --- | --- |
   | `domain-module.ts` | Complete domain module with shared/, server/, and client/ packages |

   **Consistency:** All three tiers (shared, server, client) must reference the same domain entities, use the same Zod schemas, and maintain identical naming conventions.

   **If new files are added** under `templates/` later, produce a corresponding artifact for **each** new template the same way.

   When you **create or rewrite** a domain module, you **must** deliver all three tier packages (shared, server, client) as a complete unit.

3. **Rules**
   - Generate content following rules attached to this skill, listed below, assembled from rule files in `rules/`.
   - Validate — once content is generated, take on the role of a *Peer Reviewer* and validate that the content is correct by going through each of the skill's rules one at a time and looking deeply for violations. Be helpful but critical — compare content against each rule's constraints, DO/DON'T sections and examples.

   - **Who is checking:** Software Architect verifying layer purity and dependency direction, Domain Expert verifying ubiquitous language usage, Tech Lead verifying all interfaces are fully implemented, QA Lead verifying test structure follows story-driven pattern.

4. **Scanners**
   After generating code, run the architecture scanners in `scanners/typescript/` to verify:
   - Domain structure completeness (`domain_structure_scanner.py`)
   - Layer purity — no forbidden imports (`layer_purity_scanner.py`)
   - Naming conventions per tier (`naming_convention_scanner.py`)
   - Test structure — all 3 tiers present (`test_structure_scanner.py`)

   Fix any violations before considering the implementation complete.

5. **Compilation Verification**
   After scanners pass, verify the generated code actually compiles:
   1. Run `npm install` from the workspace root — must exit with code 0.
   2. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` — must report zero errors. **This must include test files** (`tests/**/*.ts`, `tests/**/*.tsx`).
   3. If either fails, diagnose and fix (missing dependencies, type errors, import path issues) before proceeding.
   
   **This step is mandatory.** Code that does not compile is not done. Common failures:
   - Missing external dependencies in `package.json` (zod, express, mongodb, react)
   - Missing test framework packages in root devDependencies (vitest, jsdom, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @playwright/test)
   - Missing `@types/*` packages for type declarations
   - Import paths that don't resolve — verify test files use `@{appName}/{domain}-{tier}` not `@project/{domain}/{tier}`
   - TypeScript path aliases not configured for all tiers (shared, server, client) in `tsconfig.json`
   - Missing `"types"` in tsconfig for test globals (vitest/globals, @testing-library/jest-dom)
   - Controllers accessing `req.user` without Express type augmentation
   - Test runner collision: no `vitest.config.ts` or `playwright.config.ts` causes each runner to pick up the other's files

   **E2E tests (`npx playwright test`) cannot run** until `packages/app-server/` and `packages/app-client/` composition roots are scaffolded and a dev server is running. Do not instruct the user to run Playwright until those exist. Only `npx vitest --run` (unit + component tests) is available immediately after generating a domain module.

6. **Assembling this Skill**
   This Skill file is assembled from all template files in `templates/` and all rules in `rules/`. Use **`bundle_rules_into_skill_md.py`** to reassemble this skill whenever rules or templates change.

## What is Domain-First MERN Architecture?

A domain-first MERN architecture prioritizes **business capability** over technical layers. Instead of grouping all controllers together, all models together, and all views together, you group everything for a single domain (e.g., "recipients") into one package with three tiers.

The architecture is guided by four principles:

- **Domain modules over technical modules** — organizing code by business capability, then by layer within each module.
- **High alignment to ubiquitous language** — scenarios, domain models, tests, and code use consistent domain terminology.
- **Minimizing logic duplication** — shared validation, types, and business rules across client and server tiers via the `shared/` package.
- **Clean Architecture principles** — dependencies point inward toward the domain core; infrastructure is at the edges.

---

## Core concepts

### Five Architecture Layers

| Layer | Tech | Location | Responsibility |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Presentation** | React, Hooks, TSX | `client/` | Render UI, capture input, manage local state |
| **Interface Adapters** | Express Router, Axios/Fetch | `server/routes.ts`, `client/api.ts` | Translate HTTP ↔ Application calls |
| **Application** | Plain TypeScript classes | `server/service.ts` | Orchestrate use cases, coordinate domain + infra |
| **Domain Core** | Plain TypeScript | `shared/` | Business rules, validation, domain logic (SHARED) |
| **Infrastructure** | MongoDB, external APIs | `server/repository.ts` | Persist data, call external services |

### Domain-First File Structure

Every domain module follows the pattern `packages/{domain}/{shared|client|server}`:

- `shared/` — Domain entities, value objects, Zod schemas, collection classes. **Zero framework imports.** Portable to both browser and Node.js.
- `server/` — Express routes, controllers, application services, MongoDB repositories. Imports from `shared/`.
- `client/` — React components, custom hooks, API client functions. Imports from `shared/`.

### Shared Domain Logic Strategy

Domain logic is defined **once** in `shared/` and imported by both tiers:
- **Zod schemas** — validate at repository boundary (server) AND form boundary (client)
- **Domain entities** — business methods like `isEligibleForPayment()` used everywhere
- **Collection classes** — `Recipients.filterByStatus('Active')` works identically on both tiers

### Story-Driven Testing

Tests mirror the story graph hierarchy:
- **Epic** → test folder
- **Sub-Epic** → nested test folder
- **Lowest Sub-Epic** → 3 test files (server, client, E2E)
- **Story** → test class
- **Scenario** → test method with Given/When/Then helpers

---

## Example

**Domain: Recipients** (from the architecture reference)

```typescript
// packages/recipients/shared/RecipientStatus.ts
export class RecipientStatus {
  constructor(
    public readonly status: RecipientStatusType,
    public readonly createdAt: Date,
    private readonly countryCode: 'US' | 'MX' = 'US'
  ) {}

  isEligibleForPayment(): boolean {
    return this.status === 'Active';
  }

  get remainingPendingMinutes(): number | null {
    if (this.countryCode !== 'MX' || this.status !== 'Pending') return null;
    const elapsed = Date.now() - this.createdAt.getTime();
    return Math.ceil(Math.max(0, 30 * 60 * 1000 - elapsed) / 60000);
  }
}

// packages/recipients/shared/Recipients.ts
export class Recipients {
  constructor(private readonly items: Recipient[]) {}

  filterByStatus(status: RecipientStatusType): Recipients {
    return new Recipients(this.items.filter(r => r.status.status === status));
  }

  search(query: string): Recipients {
    const lower = query.toLowerCase();
    return new Recipients(this.items.filter(r =>
      r.name.toLowerCase().includes(lower)
    ));
  }

  toArray(): Recipient[] { return [...this.items]; }
}

// packages/recipients/server/recipients.service.ts
export class RecipientsService {
  constructor(private repo: RecipientsRepository) {}

  async getRecipients(enterpriseId: string, filters?: { activeOnly?: boolean }) {
    const all = await this.repo.findByEnterprise(enterpriseId);
    let recipients = new Recipients(all);  // SHARED collection class
    if (filters?.activeOnly) {
      recipients = recipients.filterByStatus('Active');  // SHARED method
    }
    return recipients.toArray();
  }
}

// packages/recipients/client/useRecipients.ts
export function useRecipients() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<Recipient[]>([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchRecipients({ activeOnly: true }).then(setItems);
  }, []);

  const filterBySearch = useCallback((query: string) => {
    return new Recipients(items).search(query).toArray();  // SAME shared logic
  }, [items]);

  return { items, filterBySearch };
}
```

## The shape of a domain-first MERN module

```
packages/<domain>/
├── shared/                          # Domain Core (plain TypeScript + Zod)

```

Key structural rules:
- `shared/` has **zero** imports from `express`, `react`, `mongodb`, `mongoose`
- `server/` imports from `shared/` — never from `client/`
- `client/` imports from `shared/` — never from `server/`
- Zod schemas in `shared/` are used by both repository (`.parse()`) and forms (`.safeParse()`)
- Domain entity methods (e.g., `isEligibleForPayment()`) are called from both tiers

---

## Build

**Goal:** Author a complete domain module — turn domain requirements into all three tier packages as defined by the template.

- **Outputs:** One complete domain module with `shared/`, `client/`, `server/` packages. Each tier has its own `package.json` and `index.ts`.
- **Per format:** shared/ contains entities + schemas + collections. server/ contains routes + controller + service + repository. client/ contains components + hooks + API client.
- **While writing:** Use domain language for all names. Keep shared/ framework-free. Validate Zod schemas at boundaries. Business logic on entities, not services.
- **Persistence:** Monorepo `package.json` with workspaces pointing to all tier packages.

**Build steps:**
1. Identify the domain entity and its responsibilities from the story/requirements.
2. Create `shared/` — entity class, value objects, Zod schema, collection class.
3. Create `server/` — repository (MongoDB + schema validation), service (orchestration using shared collection), controller (HTTP parsing), routes (URL mapping).
4. Create `client/` — API client (fetch wrapper), hook (state + shared collection for filtering), components (list + card).
5. Create test structure — `tests/{epic}/{sub-epic}/` with helpers and 3 tier test files.
6. Run scanners to verify structural compliance.

---

## Validate

**Goal:** Inspect what was built — read the artifacts as reviewers, not a second authoring pass.

- **Who is checking:** Software Architect (layer purity, dependency direction), Domain Expert (ubiquitous language, entity behavior), Tech Lead (full interface implementation, no stubs), QA Lead (test structure, all 3 tiers, Given/When/Then).
- **Cross-artifact parity:** shared/ entities used identically by both client/ and server/. Same Zod schema validates on both sides. Collection class methods produce same results regardless of tier.

**Validation checklist:**

- Every domain entity in `shared/` has business methods — no anemic data bags.
- `shared/` contains zero framework imports (`express`, `react`, `mongodb`, `mongoose`).
- `server/` does not import from `client/`; `client/` does not import from `server/`.
- Zod schema is used at repository boundary (`.parse()`) AND API/form boundary (`.safeParse()`).
- Each domain module has `index.ts` and `package.json` in every tier.
- `server/` has `*.routes.ts`, `*.controller.ts`, `*.service.ts`, `*.repository.ts`.
- `client/` has `*.api.ts`, `use*.ts`, `*.tsx` components.
- Test folders follow `tests/{epic}/{sub-epic}/` with 3 tier files + helpers/.
- All interfaces use TypeScript `implements` keyword for compile-time verification.
- Test methods mirror Gherkin scenario titles using Given/When/Then helpers.

Run scanners as final verification: `domain_structure_scanner.py`, `layer_purity_scanner.py`, `naming_convention_scanner.py`, `test_structure_scanner.py`.

### Rule: Organize by Domain Module

Organize code by **business capability** (domain module) first, then by technical layer within each module. This ensures that all code for a single domain lives together — changes rarely ripple to other domains, teams can own entire domains, and each module can become its own microservice later without restructuring.

#### DO

- Structure each domain as `packages/{domain}/{shared|client|server}`.
- Include `index.ts` and `package.json` in each tier folder for clean imports.
- Keep the app shell (`app-server/`, `app-client/`) at the packages level as composition roots.
- Place test files under `tests/{epic}/{sub-epic}/` mirroring the domain structure.

```
project-root/
├── packages/
│   ├── recipients/              # Domain module
│   │   ├── shared/
│   │   ├── client/
│   │   └── server/
│   ├── app-server/
│   └── app-client/
├── tests/
└── package.json
```

#### DON'T

- Organize by technical layer at the top level (`controllers/`, `models/`, `views/`, `routes/`).
- Scatter a single domain's code across multiple unrelated folders.
- Mix multiple domain concerns in a single folder.

---
scanner: layer_purity_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Maintain Layer Purity

Dependencies point inward toward the domain core. The `shared/` package contains **plain TypeScript only** — no framework imports. The `server/` package never imports from `client/`, and vice versa.

#### DO

- Keep `shared/` free of Express, React, MongoDB, Mongoose, and any infrastructure framework.
- Import domain logic from `shared/` into both `client/` and `server/`.

```typescript
// packages/recipients/shared/RecipientStatus.ts — plain TypeScript only
export class RecipientStatus {
  isEligibleForPayment(): boolean {
    return this.status === 'Active';
  }
}
```

#### DON'T

- Import Express, React, MongoDB, or any framework/infrastructure library in `shared/`.
- Import `client/` code from `server/` or `server/` code from `client/`.

---
scanner: domain_structure_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Share Domain Logic

Define domain entities, value objects, Zod validation schemas, and business rule methods **once** in the `shared/` package. Both `client/` and `server/` import from `shared/` — never duplicate validation, type definitions, or business logic across tiers.

#### DO

- Place all Zod schemas in `shared/` so both tiers validate identically.
- Define domain entity classes with business methods in `shared/`.
- Export collection/aggregate classes from `shared/` for reuse in both tiers.

#### DON'T

- Duplicate Zod schemas or validation logic between `client/` and `server/`.
- Redefine TypeScript interfaces that already exist in `shared/`.
- Create separate "client types" and "server types" for the same domain concept.

---
scanner: naming_convention_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Use Ubiquitous Language

Class names, file names, method names, and test names come from the **domain model** and **Gherkin scenarios**. Technical suffixes like `Manager`, `Handler`, `Processor`, `Helper`, or `Utility` hide domain intent and must be avoided on domain classes.

#### DO

- Name domain classes after domain nouns: `Recipient`, `BeneficiaryBank`, `RecipientSelection`.
- Name domain methods after domain verbs: `isEligibleForPayment()`, `filterByStatus()`.
- Name test methods to mirror Gherkin scenarios verbatim.
- Use server-tier naming: `{domain}.routes.ts`, `{domain}.controller.ts`, `{domain}.repository.ts`.

#### DON'T

- Use `Manager`, `Handler`, `Processor`, `Helper`, `Utility`, `Utils` on domain classes.
- Name test methods with technical jargon instead of scenario language.

---
scanner: domain_structure_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Implement Domain Entities Correctly

Business rules belong **on domain classes**, not in services. Domain entities own their state and behavior. Zod schemas validate at the **repository boundary** and at the **API boundary**. Collection classes provide domain-oriented query methods.

#### DO

- Place business logic as methods on the entity or value object that owns the data.
- Create collection classes that wrap arrays with domain-oriented filter/search methods.
- Validate with `Schema.parse()` at the repository boundary.
- Keep domain classes portable: no framework imports, no side effects, no async.

#### DON'T

- Place business rules in services while leaving entities as plain data objects (Anemic Domain Model).
- Put async operations or framework calls inside domain entities.

---
scanner: test_structure_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Test Story-Driven

Tests mirror story scenarios across three tiers: Server-Side, Client-Side, and E2E. The test folder hierarchy maps to the story graph: Epic → Folder, Sub-Epic → Folder, Lowest Sub-Epic → 3 test files.

#### DO

- Create exactly 3 test files per lowest sub-epic: `*_server.test.ts`, `*_client.test.tsx`, `*_e2e.spec.ts`.
- Create a `helpers/` folder per sub-epic with base, server, client, and e2e helpers.
- Name test methods to mirror Gherkin scenario titles verbatim.
- Use Given/When/Then helper methods that read like scenario steps.

#### DON'T

- Skip any of the three test tiers for a sub-epic.
- Write tests without Given/When/Then helper methods.
- Place test files outside the epic/sub-epic folder structure.

---
scanner: test_structure_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Run E2E Tests

End-to-end tests are **mandatory** for every sub-epic. E2E tests must reuse the base helper class, verify **logic** (not just element presence), and be executed as a final verification step.

#### DO

- Create `*_e2e.spec.ts` for every lowest sub-epic.
- Assert on domain logic outcomes: filtered lists, eligibility, domain rules.
- Run E2E tests after implementation as final verification.

#### DON'T

- Skip E2E tests for any sub-epic.
- Write E2E tests that only check element presence without verifying logic.
- Write E2E tests from scratch without reusing the helper class.
- Tell the user `npx playwright test` is runnable before `app-server/` and `app-client/` are scaffolded — E2E tests require a live server and will fail with `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`.

---
scanner: layer_purity_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Implement Full Interfaces

Every layer that claims to implement a domain interface must implement **all members**. Test adapters must correctly implement domain interfaces. Verify completeness at compile time using TypeScript `implements`.

#### DO

- Implement every method and property defined in the domain interface.
- Use TypeScript `implements` keyword so the compiler catches missing members.
- Ensure test adapters (mocks, fakes) implement the full interface.

#### DON'T

- Leave interface methods unimplemented or stubbed with `throw new Error('not implemented')`.
- Skip `implements` keyword.
- Create test adapters that only implement methods used in one test.

---
scanner: domain_structure_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Use Valid Package Names

Package names in `package.json` must be valid npm package names that pass `npm install` without errors. Derive the scope name from the **application's purpose** — not from generic placeholders.

**Naming pattern:** `@{appName}/{domainName}-{tier}`

Where:
- `{appName}` is derived from the application's purpose (e.g., `taskflow`, `payhub`, `channelone`)
- `{domainName}` is the domain module name (e.g., `recipients`, `todo-lists`, `payments`)
- `{tier}` is `shared`, `server`, or `client`

#### DO

- Derive the app scope name from the application's business purpose: `@taskflow`, `@payhub`, `@shopfront`.
- Use the pattern `@{appName}/{domainName}-{tier}` for tier packages.
- Ensure every `package.json` name passes `npm install` without `EINVALIDPACKAGENAME`.
- Keep names lowercase, URL-friendly (alphanumeric, hyphens only after scope).
- Use the same package name as the `import ... from` specifier in all TypeScript source files — **including test files and test helpers**.

```json
{
  "name": "@taskflow/todo-lists-shared",
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

```typescript
// Import path MUST match the package.json "name" field — in production AND test code
import { TodoList } from '@taskflow/todo-lists-shared';
import { TodoListsService } from '@taskflow/todo-lists-server';
import { TodoListList } from '@taskflow/todo-lists-client';
```

#### DON'T

- Use `@project`, `@acme`, or other generic placeholder scope names.
- Put multiple slashes in a package name: `@project/todo-lists/shared` is invalid npm.
- Leave template placeholder names in generated output.
- Use filesystem-style paths (e.g., `@scope/domain/tier`) as TypeScript import specifiers — use the package name (`@scope/domain-tier`).

---
scanner: layer_purity_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Ensure Type-Safe Controllers

Controllers in the `server/` tier must compile without implicit `any` types or missing property errors. When controllers access extended Express `Request` properties (e.g., `req.user`), include a type augmentation.

#### DO

- Include `declare global { namespace Express { interface Request { user?: { id: string }; } } }` when accessing `req.user`.
- Type all lambda/callback parameters explicitly when `noImplicitAny` or `strict` is enabled.
- Use domain types from `shared/` for callback parameters rather than `any`.

```typescript
import { Request, Response } from 'express';

declare global {
  namespace Express {
    interface Request {
      user?: { id: string };
    }
  }
}
```

#### DON'T

- Access `req.user` or extended properties without a type declaration (causes TS2339).
- Leave callback parameters untyped under `strict` mode (causes TS7006).
- Use `(req as any).user` to bypass type checking — augment the type instead.
- Suppress errors with `// @ts-ignore` instead of providing proper types.

---
scanner: domain_structure_scanner.py
---

### Rule: Include All External Dependencies

Every `package.json` must declare all external packages that its source files import. After `npm install`, the project must compile with zero unresolved module errors.

**Required dependencies by tier:**

| Tier | dependencies | devDependencies |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| shared/ | `zod` | — |
| server/ | `express`, `mongodb`, workspace shared | `@types/express` |
| client/ | `react`, `react-dom`, workspace shared | `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom` |
| root | — | `typescript`, `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@playwright/test` |

**Test dependencies:** When generating test files, the root `package.json` must include `vitest`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, and `@playwright/test`. The `tsconfig.json` must include `"types": ["vitest/globals", "@testing-library/jest-dom"]` and include `tests/**/*.ts` + `tests/**/*.tsx` in `include`.

**Use `vitest` imports in all unit/component tests — never `node:test`.** All `*_server.test.ts` and `*_client.test.tsx` files must import `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeEach`, and `vi` from `'vitest'`. Mixing `node:test` with Vitest causes "No test suite found" failures.

**Test runner config files are required.** Create `vitest.config.ts` (include `*_server.test.ts` + `*_client.test.tsx`, environment `jsdom`) and `playwright.config.ts` (testMatch `*_e2e.spec.ts`) to prevent runners from picking up each other's files. Without these, Playwright errors with ESM/CJS import failures on `vitest` module.

**Test path aliases:** The `tsconfig.json` must have path aliases for **all** tier packages (shared, server, client) plus wildcard paths for sub-module imports:
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@appName/domain-shared": ["./packages/domain/shared/index.ts"],
    "@appName/domain-server": ["./packages/domain/server/index.ts"],
    "@appName/domain-client": ["./packages/domain/client/index.ts"],
    "@appName/domain-client/*": ["./packages/domain/client/*"]
  }
}
```

#### DO

- List every imported external module in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`.
- Include `@types/*` packages for libraries without bundled declarations.
- Use caret ranges (`^`) for external packages: `"zod": "^3.22.0"`.
- Include `typescript` in root `devDependencies`.
- Run `npm install` + `npx tsc --noEmit` after generation to verify compilation.

#### DON'T

- Omit external packages and rely on hoisting or implicit resolution.
- Generate source files that import modules not listed in any `package.json`.
- Skip `@types/*` packages — TypeScript will fail with `Could not find a declaration file`.
- Use `*` or `latest` for external packages (only for workspace internal references).
- Consider the implementation complete if `npm install` or `tsc` fails.
