# Impact map — ASCII wall sketch (markdown)

## Instructions (for skill maintainers)

- This file mirrors the **four-column impact map wall** used in **Lean-Agile Training** (Agile By Design): **Objective (Why?)**, **Persona (Who?)**, **Impact (How?)**, **Initiative (What?)** — same reading order as **`inputs/abd-answers-retrieval.md`** Kept chunks 1-3 and the prefix map in **`impact-map.md`** / **`impact-map.txt`**.
- **Layout:** Pipe-separated columns. **Objective** holds the goal stack (broad then mapped sub-goals); use **`#`** on its own line under a goal in that column for **lagging proof** (same facts as **`METRIC:`** under a **`GOAL:`**). For each **actor / impact**, follow the wall map order: a row with **Persona** and **Impact** and an empty **Initiative** cell; then an optional row with **`#`** only in the **Impact** column (behaviour proxy, same fact as **`METRIC:`** under that **`IMPACT:`**); then one row per **`DELIVERABLE:`** (repeat persona and impact on each initiative row). Leave **Persona** empty on **`#`** metric rows.
- Fill the **Template** block: replace every `{{placeholder}}`. Use **ASCII only** (no Unicode box drawing). Stakeholder deliverable = filled table (column headers optional if the room already has a poster; keep **`#`** metric rows).
- **Parity:** Same goals, actors, impacts, metrics, and initiatives as **`impact-map.md`** / **`impact-map.txt`**; this is the **same map** in slide-style columns, not a different story.

## Notation

- **OBJECTIVE column:** Top = broad **`GOAL:`** headline; optional **`#`** line = lagging proof; then mapped **`GOAL:`**; optional **`#`** lines for each **`METRIC:`** under that goal in the hierarchy.
- **PERSONA / IMPACT / INITIATIVE columns:** One **initiative** row per **`DELIVERABLE:`** line; repeat persona and impact text when the same behaviour has several deliverables.
- **`#` (impact):** Behaviour or usage proxy for that impact only; place it **before** the initiative rows for that impact; omit if there is no impact metric in the hierarchy.
- **NOTE / ASSUMPTION:** Same as prefix map; place **`NOTE:`** / **`ASSUMPTION:`** in the Objective column after the goal stack, or below the table.

## Example (reference)

**Audience:** Facilitators and agents — same fictional live-ops engagement as **`impact-map.md`** Example (reference); columns match the training wall map shape.
