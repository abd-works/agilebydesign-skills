# Impact map (markdown)

## Instructions (for skill maintainers)

- Fill the **Template** section: replace every `{{placeholder}}` with engagement content. Do not paste this Instructions block into stakeholder deliverables.
- Goal — Broader to finer; one `GOAL:` per level. Actors under the mapped `GOAL:`.
- Keep each `GOAL:` and `IMPACT:` line **behavioural / directional only** — no embedded cadence (e.g. weekly), deadlines (e.g. by day 3), thresholds, or SLA timing. Put those on `METRIC:` lines under the right parent (`GOAL:` vs `IMPACT:`).
- `METRIC:`, `NOTE:`, `ASSUMPTION:` optional per `SKILL.md`.
- Repeat `ACTOR:` / `IMPACT:` / `DELIVERABLE:` blocks as needed; add or remove deliverable lines per impact.

## Notation

- Goal — `GOAL:`; directional outcome in the world.
- Metric (goal) — `METRIC:` indented under a `GOAL:`; lagging proof for that goal (one or more lines).
- Actor — `ACTOR:`; situational who.
- Impact — `IMPACT:`; observable behaviour.
- Metric (impact) — `METRIC:` indented under an `IMPACT:`; behaviour or usage proxy (optional).
- Deliverable — `DELIVERABLE:`; option under impact (one or more).

Feature backlog (phased) — optional; each row names **phase**, **feature**, and **actor / impact** (same pair as one branch in the tree above):

| Phase | Feature | Actor / impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| {{phase_1}} | {{feature_1}} | {{actor_impact_1}} |
| {{phase_2}} | {{feature_2}} | {{actor_impact_2}} |

## Example (reference)

**Audience:** Facilitators and agents — same fictional live-ops engagement as **`SKILL.md`** Example; mirror depth and prefix discipline, not these literal product names.

```text
GOAL: Strengthen recurring revenue and engagement in the flagship live-ops title
GOAL: Grow monthly active players
  METRIC: Verified MAU +20% vs last-quarter baseline this quarter (strategic adoption)
  METRIC: Net revenue from live ops +12% YoY (economic)
  NOTE: M1-M4 below = calendar months in this example; use quarters if the brief says Q1-Q4 instead.
  ASSUMPTION: Moderator SLA stays feasible at projected creator stream volume; re-check if partner hours watched doubles before M3.

  ACTOR: Existing players
    IMPACT: Share run highlights to social
      METRIC: % of actives posting any share weekly; target 15%+
      DELIVERABLE: Share sheet with clip
      DELIVERABLE: Seasonal tournament badge (shareable moment)
      DELIVERABLE: Friend invite deep link
    IMPACT: Complete challenges on schedule
      METRIC: Challenge completion rate among MAU; target 40%+
      DELIVERABLE: Streak and progress widget
      DELIVERABLE: Push notification preferences (challenge nudges)

  ACTOR: New players
    IMPACT: Finish onboarding and first ranked run without dropping
      METRIC: D1 / D7 retention; targets 45% / 25%
      DELIVERABLE: Skippable tutorial revamp
      DELIVERABLE: First-win bot match lane
    IMPACT: Accept a friend or guild connection during onboarding
      METRIC: Social graph attach rate by D3; target 30%
      DELIVERABLE: Suggested friends (consent-based contacts)

  ACTOR: Streamers and creators
    IMPACT: Broadcast this title during the campaign window
      METRIC: Partner stream hours watched per week; target 50k+; broadcast cadence at least twice per week
      DELIVERABLE: OBS overlay and scene kit
      DELIVERABLE: Creator revenue-share tier

  ACTOR: Platform moderators
    IMPACT: Triage abuse and fraud reports
      METRIC: Median time to first moderator action; target under 12 hours (SLA)
