  Teaches exploration-phase acceptance criteria for story-graph.json: WHEN/THEN/AND/BUT,
  behavioral language, atomic AC, actor alternation, channel-specific detail, and
  verb–noun naming for story elements. This skill **migrates** rules and scanners **from**
  the agile_bots repo (story_bot exploration behavior) into this skills package — it is a
  portable copy for execute_rules / CLI scanners, not a live symlink or runtime mapping.
  When building AC from sources, output **all** template artifacts in `templates/`
  (currently `acceptance-criteria.md` and `acceptance-criteria.txt`) with the same coverage.
  Use when writing or reviewing acceptance criteria, exploration behavior, WHEN/THEN
  quality, or story-graph.json AC arrays.

# abd-acceptance-criteria

## Steps

1. **Build** using **every** template file in this skill's `templates/` folder, and the `rules/` mentioned in this skill.
2. **Validate** using rules mentioned in this skill. For the **mechanical** scanner pass, use the **execute_rules** skill (same repo): run **`run_scanners.py`** with **`--skill-root`** = this skill directory and **`--workspace`** = the tree that contains **`docs/story/story-graph.json`** (or **`story-graph.json`**). To **list** which scanners would run, use **`rule_inventory.py --list-scanners`** with the same **`--skill-root`**. Full intent (AI/rules pass **plus** scanner pass) and exact commands are in **`skills/execute_using_rules/SKILL.md`** (Commands **§2** and **§3** where applicable). Implementation details and parity with **agile_bots** live in `scanners/README.md` when present. **Which** scanners run is defined only by **`rules/*.md`** (`scanner:` frontmatter → `scanners/<stem>-scanner.py`), not a separate manifest. **Story graph** types (`StoryMap`, `StoryScanner`, …) live in **`skills/story-graph-ops/scripts/`** (`story_map.py`, `story_scanner.py`, …); generic scanner types come from **`execute_using_rules`** **`scanner_bases`**. **`scanner_runner`** (execute_rules) drives every scanner CLI the same way (context holds files and/or graph JSON). For **CLI** read/search/filter/write on `story-graph.json` without the bot, use **`skills/story-graph-ops/`** (**story-graph-ops** skill).

### Use every template file (required)

When you **create or rewrite** acceptance criteria from requirements, you **must** deliver **one output artifact per file** in `templates/`. **Do not** emit only Markdown or only plain text unless the user **explicitly** asks for a single format.

| Template | What to produce |
| --- | --- |
| `templates/acceptance-criteria.md` | Story-level AC using WHEN/THEN/AND/BUT; include the **`## Instructions`** block from that template file at the end of the Markdown artifact (or equivalent rules summary). |
| `templates/acceptance-criteria.txt` | The **same** behavioral coverage and story semantics as **plain text** only — structure matching `acceptance-criteria.txt` style (no requirement to duplicate the full Instructions block in `.txt`). |

**Consistency:** WHEN/THEN semantics, story coverage, and ordering must match between `.md` and `.txt` for the same work. Only the Markdown file carries the full Instructions block.

**If new files are added** under `templates/` later, produce a corresponding artifact for **each** new template the same way.

**Purpose:** Describe what good **exploration-phase** acceptance criteria *are* (structure, language, rules). **How** to run the bot, workspace setup, and product-specific exploration flows belong in the agent and other skills — not here.

**Includes:** `templates/` — see **Use every template file** above; `rules/` — see bundled rules at the end of this file.

## When to use this skill

Load this skill when **any** of the following apply:

- You are writing or reviewing **`acceptance_criteria`** arrays on stories in **`story-graph.json`** (exploration phase — not scenario BDD steps).
- A user or agent wants to turn interviews, specs, or informal notes into **testable behavioral** AC (WHEN/THEN/AND/BUT).
- You need **WHEN/THEN/AND** quality, **atomic** AC (no duplicated blocks), **actor alternation**, **BUT** for negatives, or **channel-specific** CLI/Panel wording.
- An agent is asked to “explore” a story, “write AC”, “harden acceptance criteria”, or “align with exploration rules.”
- You are running **execute_rules** scanners against a workspace that contains a story graph.
- You want **parallel quality** with **abd-story-mapping** on **verb–noun** story elements while this skill owns exploration AC rules and scanners.

## What are acceptance criteria?

**Acceptance criteria** (in this skill’s sense) are **story-level, behavioral statements** in `story-graph.json` that say **under what conditions** the product behaves **how**, including chained outcomes and explicit negatives. They sit **above** BDD **scenarios** (which use Given/When/Then on steps).

Exploration-phase AC answer four questions for each story:

1. **When** does the behavior apply? (trigger, precondition, or variant.)
2. **Then** what is observable? (primary user- or system-visible outcome.)
3. **And** what else happens in sequence? (extra outcomes, especially multiple system reactions — chain with AND, not a new WHEN for each micro-step unless the trigger truly changes.)
4. **But** what must **not** happen? (errors, prevention, no persistence — negative paths.)

They are **not** implementation checklists (API names, class names, file formats) unless the story is explicitly **`story_type: technical`** and scoped that way. A good AC set can be read by a **product owner**, a **tester**, and a **developer** — all at once — and still be **machine-checkable** via rules/scanners where applicable.

**Relationship to other artifacts:**

| Artifact | Role | Typical keywords |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **acceptance_criteria** (this skill) | Story-level outcomes in the graph | WHEN, THEN, AND, BUT |
| **scenarios** (later / other workflow) | BDD flows with steps | Given, When, Then on **steps** |

Reserve **Given** for **scenarios**, not for lines inside **`acceptance_criteria`** (per agile_bots exploration policy).

---

## Core concepts

### Behavioral vs technical

AC describe **observable** user/system behavior. Avoid implementation detail unless the story is explicitly technical.

| Prefer | Avoid (unless technical story) |
| --- | --- |
| “WHEN user submits … THEN CLI returns success with timestamp” | “WHEN `submit()` is called on `CliSession`…” |
| Concrete channels: `cli.shape.validate`, Panel label text | Generic “the bot does the right thing” |

### WHEN / THEN / AND / BUT

| Keyword | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **WHEN** | Trigger or precondition. |
| **THEN** | Primary outcome. |
| **AND** | Additional or chained outcomes (especially multiple system reactions). |
| **BUT** | What does **not** happen (error/prevention paths). |

### Atomic AC

State the **general** case **once**; follow-on AC only describe **deltas**. Reduces duplicated WHEN/THEN blocks (see **Atomic acceptance criteria** rule).

### Actor alternation

Interleave user-visible and system-visible emphasis. Avoid long runs of the same actor without switching (see **Alternate actors in steps** rule + scanner).

### Domain consistency

As domains grow, keep **parallel** AC structure across related areas; **split stories** when one AC mixes incompatible domain behaviors.

## The shape of good acceptance criteria

```
Story: Submit Order
  acceptance_criteria:
  1. WHEN user has items in cart AND cart total is valid
     THEN checkout shows confirmation
     AND order id is displayed
  2. WHEN payment gateway times out
     THEN user sees retry message
     BUT order is not marked paid
```

Notice:

- **WHEN** sets scope; **THEN** is the main observable; **AND** chains extra outcomes; **BUT** guards negatives.
- Second AC is a **delta** (error path), not a full repeat of the happy path.
- Language stays **behavioral** and **channel-aware** where the product has distinct surfaces.

---

## Build

Produce **both** **`acceptance-criteria.md`** and **`acceptance-criteria.txt`** artifacts (same coverage), following **`templates/acceptance-criteria.md`** and **`templates/acceptance-criteria.txt`** respectively. See **Steps → Use every template file** — delivering a single format is incorrect unless the user explicitly requested only one. Match the bar under **Validate** below. Structure follows **WHEN/THEN/AND/BUT** and **atomic** deltas as above; keep discovery to **story-level** AC unless a later workflow adds or edits **scenarios**.

---

## Validate

Review **both** the **`.md`** and **`.txt`** and the story graph for:

- **Structure** — WHEN/THEN/AND/BUT used appropriately; **Given** not used inside `acceptance_criteria`.
- **Behavioral** language and **channel-specific** detail where CLI vs Panel differ.
- **Atomic** AC (no duplicated base WHEN/THEN blocks).
- **Actor** alternation and **AND** chaining for sequential reactions.
- **Verb–noun** names for epics/sub-epics/stories (shared bar with **abd-story-mapping**; this skill ships the exploration **verb–noun** scanner migrated from agile_bots).

Revise until a product owner, a tester, and a developer can agree on what “done” means for the story.

Run mechanical scanners via **execute_rules** as described in **Steps**.

## Migration source (agile_bots)

This skill is **migrated from** the Agile Bots codebase — not merely “mapped” to it:

| Role | Location in agile_bots |
| --- | --- |
| Rule definitions (priority, DO/DON'T, examples) | `bots/story_bot/behaviors/exploration/rules/*.json` |
| Scanner implementations | `src/scanners/*` (classes referenced by those JSON files) |

**Canonical product behavior** may continue to evolve in **agile_bots** first. When rules or scanners change there, **re-migrate** (copy + adapt imports) into this skill so Open Agent Skills / `execute_rules` stay aligned.
