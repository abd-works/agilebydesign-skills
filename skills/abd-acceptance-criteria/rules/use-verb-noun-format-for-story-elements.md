# Rule: Verb–noun format for story elements

**Priority:** 1  
**Scanner:** `scanners/verb-noun-scanner.py` — **`VerbNounScanner`**

**Migrated from:** `agile_bots/bots/story_bot/behaviors/exploration/rules/use_verb_noun_format_for_story_elements.json` (implementation migrated from `agile_bots/src/scanners/verb_noun_scanner.py` + `vocabulary_helper.py`)

Use verb–noun format for **epic, sub-epic, and story names** (and align scenario/AC phrasing with the same bar). Prefer **base verb forms**; document actors separately (`story_type`, metadata).

## DO

- Verb + noun for scenario sentences and AC phrasing where applicable.
- Base verb forms (imperative / infinitive style): Select item, Display confirmation.

## DON'T

- Noun-only or capability labels where an action phrase is expected.
- Gerund-led titles (`Submitting order`) or third-person singular as the wrong pattern (`Selects item`).
