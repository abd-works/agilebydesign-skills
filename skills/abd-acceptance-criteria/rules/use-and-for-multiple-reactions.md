# Rule: Use AND for multiple reactions

**Priority:** (see agile_bots JSON)  
**Scanner:** `scanners/reaction-chaining-scanner.py` — **`ReactionChainingScanner`**

**Migrated from:** `agile_bots/bots/story_bot/behaviors/exploration/rules/use_and_for_multiple_reactions.json`

Chain sequential **system** reactions with **AND** under the same trigger. Avoid separate **WHEN** for each micro-step when the trigger is the same. Limit **AND** chains to a reasonable length (scanner warns when excessive).

## DO

- Chain related system outcomes with AND.

## DON'T

- Use separate WHEN/THEN pairs for sequential system-only actions that belong to one reaction chain.
