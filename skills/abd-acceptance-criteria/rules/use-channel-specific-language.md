# Rule: Use channel-specific language

**Priority:** (see agile_bots JSON)  
**Scanner:** `scanners/channel-specific-language-scanner.py` — **`ChannelSpecificLanguageScanner`**

**Migrated from:** `agile_bots/bots/story_bot/behaviors/exploration/rules/use_channel_specific_language.json`

Prefer concrete CLI, Panel, or API surface detail over generic "Bot/System" wording when the product has distinct channels.

## DO

- Include concrete examples: `cli.` paths, quoted UI labels, explicit panel copy.

## DON'T

- Rely on generic "Bot …" steps without concrete syntax or UI cues (scanner warns).
